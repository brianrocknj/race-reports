### Training
I ran my first marathon in July 2023 and finished at 3:21:26. Set a goal to run sub-2:50 at CIM 2024 to eventually qualify for Boston. Over the past 16 months, I worked on improving my speed by training for a 5K, then a 10K, then a half-marathon, and culminating with CIM. 

I read *Faster Road Racing* and *Advanced Marathoning* by Pfitz, which helped accelerate my development. I was averaging 35 mpw for the July marathon training block and peaked at 50. I basically followed the training plans by the book, with the 12/50 plans for the 5K and 10K, base building up to 65 mpw in between 10K and HM, 12/70 for the half marathon, and then 18/85 for the marathon. I increased mileage steadily week to week, which I credit for staying healthy throughout the past year. The training was successful and I set PRs across the board (18:16 5K, 36:27 10K). 

I really enjoyed the actual marathon training block and was in a solid rhythm all 18 weeks. Didn't miss a day of training. Hardest workout was the 20 mile run with 14 miles at marathon pace. My goal was 2:50 and I initially struggled with the pace runs (6:29/mi), but as the block went on, I felt more confident in that I could beat the goal by a few minutes or so.

### Pre-race
Drove to downtown Sacramento from San Francisco on Saturday morning before the race. I panicked a bit about what to wear. I never documented clothes and temperature in my training notes, which I regretted. It was ~ 45 degrees F at start time and I went with a tank top, which was a good decision since the sun came out and I was feeling hot.

I didn't have a throwaway outer layer at the start line like many others, so I was feeling cold. I warmed up with 5 minutes easy, 10 minutes of stretching, and then a 1 minute jog. Had to pee last minute so I barely got to the start line in time because of the super long porta-potty line. The sub-2:50 corral was actually closed already so I was around the 3:05 group at the start.

### Race
Had a gnarly cramp a minute in that persisted until the 5K marker. I was panicking for a mile and trying to slow down my breathing but decided to just ignore it. It went away when I took my mind off of it, so maybe it was due to nervousness.

I tried to do the first half conservatively and finish string, but my early splits were WAY faster than my perceived effort. I slowed down a bit after 10K since I knew sub-19 5K splits were unsustainable. Glad I did because I started feeling the fatigue around mile 16. I was telling myself to survive till mile 20 and re-assess - those 4 miles felt really long.

At mile 20, I was feeling strong enough to finish but did not have the energy to pick up the pace. My mile pace from 20 mi -> finish was around 6:35, which is slightly disappointing since I wanted to finish at faster than race pace, but maybe it would not have made a difference in overall time if I started slower. 

I dug deep to open up my stride with a mile left to finish. My body only had that mile in me, I was pretty damn sore but the adrenaline pushed me to sprint the final stretch.

### Post-race
I was really stoked to beat my goal by a decent amount. Grabbed the swag, food, and free beer before ringing the Boston bell. Was surreal to actually ring the bell since I've been dreaming about running a BQ for over a year now. 

Took a shower, ate brunch with family, and set back to the Bay Area. Legs felt no different than after a long run, so I was able to do a short recovery run the next day and have spent the last 3 weeks running less than ""usual"" and doing other activities like snowboarding and basketball (things I avoided recently to prevent injury).

Really happy with the race itself and also the overall race experience. CIM was really well organized and I think I will run it again eventually. Not sure what my next running goals are, but I would like to try to train for a sub-5 mile at some point.

Would appreciate any feedback to help me improve my training.  Cheers everybody, this sub helped me a lot!

I have a small improvement for the race reports.

I always find myself reading through a journal entry type report on training methods for every race report. A lot of the time I’m looking for specific stats, but need to read though paragraphs of random details to find it, if it was even included at all.

My suggestion is to add the following subsections onto the “Training” section of race reports. Each metric as applicable.

**Background and Training**

I'm a 61-year-old male (I'll be 62 this week) in what I describe as my third act of running. Act I was a pretty successful high school career before a car crash derailed college athletics. Act II began with Couch-to-5K in my late 30s and led to 20 marathons and a PR of 3:08. Heel issues cost me nearly a decade before I started up again in 2018 and slowly worked my way back towards distance running. I ran NYC 2023 to celebrate turning 60 and by the end of 2025, will have my total marathon count up to 26 or 27. I've also run at least a mile for nearly 2,500 straight days.

I'm working hard to try to qualify for Boston this year. I nominally need 3:50 but realistically, probably somewhere around 3:44. I'm aiming for the Jim Thorpe marathon in late April for my first attempt but am ready to try an early September marathon if necessary. I'm a subscriber with Runcoach (runcoach.com) and have been very happy with the coaching I have received. The program has an algorithm that adjusts workouts and predicted time based on workouts, race results, etc. It predicted that my finishing time for the 20-miler would be 2:59, so I was very pleased to beat that.

**Pre-Race**

I live in Brooklyn, so this was a destination run for me. I probably would not have signed up if my sister had not also done so. My wife and I stayed in New Bedford the night before so we could have dinner with her brother. The morning of the race, we ate breakfast in the hotel (orange, English muffin, and banana for me) and then drove to the ferry to Martha's Vineyard. It was a nice, easy 40-minute drive and we got there about a half hour before the 9:30 departure. The boat, as you can imagine, was filled with runners and I had some nice chats on the way over. Once I got to Martha's Vineyard, bib-pickup was a snap. The race organizers offered everyone hand warmers and helpfully told us that all the race swag would be handed out at the end. Bag drop was also available. Conditions were about as good as you could hope: 30F, some clouds, dry, and calm. Pretty remarkable, given the major winter storm scheduled for later in the day. Despite the cold, all the volunteers were cheerful and welcoming.

This was my second marathon. 9 months after my first one where I ran a 3:43:00

**Pre-Race:**

Drove to Mesa, AZ with my wife from San Diego (5.5 hr drive) the day before. Went straight into the expo around 2pm. Checked into our hotel, grabbed some Cava for dinner and was in bed around 7:30pm but didn't fall asleep until 9pm. Woke up at 3am and got a ride from my wife (she's the best) to the bus pickup at 4:15 am. 

  
Had two slices of peanut butter, honey, and banana on sourdough bread with a shaker bottle full of BPN's G1M about 1.5 hours before the race. I was able to get all of it out of my system before the race without a problem. 

**During the Race:**

* **Miles 1–4:** Knew that this portion was steeply downhill and I was aiming for 6:55-7:05/mi depending on how I felt as I didn't want to get eager especially knowing there was a hill coming up from mile 4-5.5. Felt like I was just gliding through this portion while staying disciplined.
* **Miles 5–6:** About a 250 ft of uphill for the next 1.5 miles. I knew that if I pushed it here, I would pay for it later so my main focus was to just breathe and relax through this portion and take in a gel at the bottom of the hill. Once the hill flattened out, I gave myself about 30-seconds to get my breathing together and let it rip down the hill. I wanted to build up some momentum to get my legs turning over again and build some consistency for the next 12 miles that way I can just turn off my brain and simply cruise at the speed I wanted. 
* **Miles 7–12:** Surprised myself here thinking that my pace could possibly be hard to keep up for oh so many miles, but just remembered to shut my brain off, enjoy the race, have some fun, and just look ahead. On mile 8 I took my first caffeine gel which absolutely woke me up if you compare mile 8 vs. 9.
* **Miles 13–20:** 13-15 were kind of a blur as I knew i just wanted to stay consistent. Mile 18 is where I made a decision based on how I felt to either push or pull back. Considering I didn't feel tired nor was I dealing with any muscle issues, I decided to push into a new gear. Yet, that didn't last long as I started to take SaltStix every other mile with my hammy cramping up and me missing the gatorade on the course due to runner traffic (guy stopped right in the middle of the aid station area)
* **Miles 22–24:** Mile 22.5 is where my hamstring just felt so weakened that I could feel it throbbing like no other. It took into effect as I was noticeably slowing down. I wanted to conserve my leg for the last 2 miles knowing that I would unload the tank as best as I could to get to sub 3. According to my watch I was on track. On mile 24 I was taking my last gel and this guy in front of me projectile vomited and it was a struggle to bring that gel down. I had to fight the urge to puke for half a mile, but got through it
* **Miles 25–Finish:** This is where I just emptied the tank with everything I had. Heavy breathing and full determination to get past everyone in front of me. I ran towards the finish noticing it showing ""3:00:36"" and couldn't remember if I started the race 30-seconds after the gun or not...but more importantly i was very happy to just finish. 

**Post-Race:**

I was so eager to find out if I hit my goal of going sub 3 and went to the results table and found out I was off by 18 seconds according to the chip time and was so stoked to be so close! My coros watch said differently with a time of 2:59:44. Oh well! I spent some time in the recovery tent getting my hamstring attended to and was able to walk a tiny bit better after. Got to celebrate with a XL-Coke Zero and a sandwich from Jersey Mike's before a nice, long 5.5 car ride home with my wife. 

**Final Thoughts:**

At the end of the day I'm just incredibly proud to run a great race after 9 months of dedicated training to pull off a 43-minute PR! My fueling and nutrition were on point with 6 total gels. I simulated race week with my last week of training before taper with a mini-carb load, eating the same thing the night before and the morning of and nearly the same amount of gels. Although I was 18 seconds off of a sub 3 hour (according to the chip) I can wear this Mesa Marathon medal with a ton of pride of all the hard work and dedication it took to get to this point. "
1gugtmh,2024-11-18 21:58:38+00:00,Mellenoire,,Marathon_Training,/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1gugtmh/race_report_multiple_marathons/,Race report - multiple marathons,"Yesterday I finished the Queenstown marathon, and here’s the story of how I got there. 

Coming off Sydney Marathon with 10 weeks to Queenstown, my runners knee was flaring up and I knew I had to take a bit of time before getting stuck back in, but I lasted about a week before I was risking becoming [this](https://i.imgur.com/4DchlOm.gifv). I am terrible at following a plan, so instead I take the elements of the big popular plans and try to work them into my weekly routine. 

I did a slow reverse taper, quickly building in intervals, hill work and long runs. I broke a core rule of marathon training and was adding 20-30% volume each week, but I was feeling good. I cut back on my barbell squat and front squat to take some of the load off my knee, but kept my goblet and split squat to maintain some muscle strength. 

Peak week was tough as the exhaustion was setting in. I always will run the full race distance, albeit slowly, more to give myself psychological reassurance than to do anything productive for my body. 

I did a steep taper, dropping 50% of the volume in the first week which, to be honest, was quite welcome. The last week was tough because I was in the height of taper gloomies and was chugging pre workout to get through the work day. 

Race day

One thing I didn’t prep for was the cold - we went from balmy shorts weather to below freezing, and on race morning (and I can hear you Canadians and North Europeans laughing) we really struggled with the cold. My husband found a petrol generator and while we probably gave ourselves a little poisoning from the fumes, standing next to the exhaust was a life saver. 

Apparently 2024 wasn’t a particularly cold year. But I had to keep my fleece and my thermal on for most of the race. 

Queenstown marathon advertises itself as flat out beautiful with “a few undulations”. 

While it’s no UTMB race, the first 10km is nothing but up and down, and I was grateful for a bottleneck about 4km in. Everyone was civil though, no elbows or foot stomps. The course undulates on a hard packed trail which is easy on the joints but hard mentally, there were a few rocks and branches. 

A lap around the lake was fantastic, especially as there were no mosquitos and leeches like we would find at home. Running alongside a steep drop off did set off my fear of heights a bit, but I was running into a bigger problem: feeling like there was a brick in my guts. I had had stomach problems for a few days leading in, and the problems were really starting to compound as I gave my core a “fair shake of the sauce bottle”. 

From 15-25km there’s a lot of long flat road and while it’s mostly downhill, there’s not a lot to distract you from the nagging muscle pain. The aid stations through here are top notch, with protein nibbles and fruit bread. Not that I got to enjoy any of it, it was hard enough drinking water with my stomach. 

By 25km I was hitting a big wall and genuinely contemplated dropping. My husband, bless him, wouldn’t hear of it and kept pushing me to drink, take on electrolytes, and keep moving forward. Fun fact: salted watermelon Gu is revolting and the only reason to consume it is to distract you from other unpleasant sensations. 

From 27-32km the terrain became much nicer, the trails were better established and the aid stations had flat coke. I was chugging it to get the energy from the caffeine and the bit of fizz left behind was helping break up the bloat. We were also greeted by a giant pickle who fed us lollies. 

32-37km was a slog, the views are beautiful but I was caught between being too hot, too cold, too dehydrated, too bloated to really appreciate it. I felt sorry for the guys at the red bull tent, turns out not a lot of people go for red bull at the pointy end of a marathon. 

Finally at km 37 I found my groove, found my words of affirmation, and was able to get some solid pacing in. The race organisers were a bit evil putting a hill at km 41.5, there was no way I could stop with the actual *public* cheering my name, but I was choking down vomit the whole way up. Heading into the chute finally my guts accepted that we weren’t throwing up, and we were able to do a victory run through the last timing mat. 

The vibes at the end were [top notch](https://i.imgur.com/w1UGupC.jpg), free beer, free red bull, free sunscreen, really well stocked recovery tent, but we did have to climb a flight of stairs to get to our drop bags. The race has a long cutoff so it was nice seeing the very back of the pack/sweeper crew encouraging the last finisher when we came back into town. 

I wouldn’t do it again but I would 100% recommend it for anyone looking at an Oceania destination marathon or someone considering foraying onto the trail race scene and wanting to see what it’s like. 

Aftermath 

My hammies, quads, calves, glutes, core back and shoulders are cooked."

### Training
At the beginning of the summer, I thought about signing up for this race. My only marathon (spring 2022) was very slow with a time of 4:44, but I had gotten a lot faster since then. I was thinking about attempting a BQ, which for my age group is 3:30 (25F). I started doing my long runs in the 8s instead of the 9s or 10s and kept doing the 1-2 speed workouts per week. I started coaching cross country in July and did most runs with the kids, which helped give me some structure to my looser training style. 

However, in mid July, I found a lump on my throat that concerned me. I got an appointment for bloodwork and an ultrasound, and the ultrasound revealed that my thyroid nodule was very likely cancerous. Over the next few weeks as I dealt with the struggles of biopsy and diagnosis, I cut back a bit on my running. I only wanted to run for fun, so I would approach each workout with a mindset of doing the run that I would most enjoy that day. I learned in early August that my nodule came back as papillary thyroid carcinoma, which meant I had to have surgery. I pushed for the earliest date possible and I was able to get it scheduled for August 11th, which was great. As a last hurrah before surgery, some friends and I went out for a DIY easy 50k and had a blast hanging out on the trails together.

Surgery went well and my surgeon got the entire tumor out with good margins, which was a huge mental boost. I tried to take daily walks starting three days after surgery and tried running eight days after surgery. At first, even running in the 14s made me wheezy. It felt horrible trying to breathe when running. But the more I tried running, the better it got. Three weeks after surgery, I went out for a slow and easy 20 miler which felt great. The more time passed, the better I would feel. I still got wheezy trying to run fast, but at least I could run in the 9s and high 8s and still breathe. 

A few other side effects of my thyroidectomy included heat intolerance, heart rate issues, and extreme fatigue. I would have to step into the shade during runs (which made coaching more difficult), slow down when my heart rate would spike, and take naps to compensate for the exhaustion. Because of all these issues, I just tried to go by feel and monitor my heart rate carefully. I would try to run with my kids on weekdays and do a long run each weekend, alternating between a slow trail run and a faster road run each weekend. This brought my weekly mileage to 25-35 most weeks, peaking around 35. 

I started my taper about three weeks before the marathon, cutting mileage but planning to run a trail 50k on 10/1, two weeks before Columbus. During that race, my hips hurt and I stopped after 22.75 miles, but it still functioned as a good training run.  

### Pre-race
I got up super early to take my thyroid medication and tried to go back to sleep but failed. I drank a lot of water, ate some oatmeal, and loaded up my shorts pockets with fruit snacks. My whole family was running so we drove down together, parked, and made our way to the gear check and port-a-potties. I did my dynamic warm-ups and ran a half mile warm up jog and then made my way to Corral A. Throughout the pre-race routine, I kept changing my mind about my race strategy...should I start around 9 and slowly accelerate? Or should I start at 8:30? I really had no idea what I could run. I just wanted to have fun and see what I could do without dying.

### Race
Miles 1-3 felt good, and the race day energy had me excited. I kept looking down at my watch and seeing my pace get into the low 8s, which was faster than I thought I could run. Upon seeing that my heart rate was still 170 and hadn't spiked to 180, I decided to just wing it and watch my heart rate above all else. Miles 4-13 flew by in a blur. I loved seeing the amazing signs and hearing the cheers from the crowd. Whenever my heart rate would pass 170, I would slow down to get it back down. At the half marathon mark, I saw that I had run a 1:45, which was on pace for my original dream goal of a 3:30. I wasn't even tired and my legs didn't hurt, although my feet started to feel the effects of the Saucony Endorphin Speed 2 shoes I was wearing. Mile 14 I started to get lonely without the crowd and started really missing my headphones that had just broken a few days before. Miles 15-18 my legs and feet started to really hurt. It felt like there was so much left and I hadn't seen any of my friends yet. My form started to get really bad here, which only made my legs and back hurt worse. Miles 19-20 I started getting more hopeful as I got closer to the end, realizing there was only a 10k to go. Miles 21-24 were mostly downhill and I saw two of my friends, which really helped. I still felt like trash, but the end was in sight. Mile 25 and 26 I tried to go faster, since the faster I ran, the faster I would be finished. I booked it at the finish, running at a 6:39 pace for the last .44 according to my watch. I finally crossed the finish line at 3:36:33. 

### Post-race
I found my sister who finished three minutes before me and celebrated with her. Then together, we found my parents and my fiance. We took pictures, cheered on our other friends and family, and basked in the glow of completing another marathon. I still can't believe I ran this huge of a PR just 9 weeks after having surgery and sort of winging it during my training cycle. All in all, I'm extremely blessed to be able to get back to running so soon after surgery. I know my cancer experience is very lucky compared to others. I will need regular bloodwork and ultrasounds to determine if radioactive iodine is ever needed, but that pales in comparison to the chemotherapy and radiation that most people face. 

I'm thinking in the spring I want to try and BQ for real. If I can get my weekly mileage up to 40-50 again like last fall, I bet I could aim for something in the 3:20-3:25 range. Hopefully my next training cycle is not as rudely interrupted.

Previously, I have ran St. Jude on three prior occasions including today. My times for those races are 4:17:XX (2021) and 4:27:XX (2023) and today, 3:54:XX. My other marathon times, for the Nashville RnR (2021) were 4:21:XX and Disney (2024) 4:57:XX. 

I have been chasing a sub for since 2021. I ran no marathons in 2022, but began planning for a sub-4 attempt in 2023. This involved running Hal Higdon’s Intermediate 1 plan, and hewing pretty close to the plan. Things were progressing well for 2023 St. Jude, until 8 days before the marathon when I popped positive for RSV. As a result, I dialed back my efforts for the race and changed goals to “just finish.”

My goals for this race were:

A: PR (sub 4:17:XX)
B: Sub-4
C: Sub-4:27:XX

Conditions and training plan went well, although I dropped 20lbs during the first 8 weeks of the plan to try to make running easier. This made for the most unpleasant training block I’ve ever completed. In the past marathon blocks, I actually gained 10-20lbs, which slowed my average pace down considerably. 

Today’s weather was ideal. Although I dropped 20lbs, I still weigh 185, which makes me a heavier runner for my height. Therefore, cold temperatures are my friend as I try to combat the heat. It was slightly overcast, and ranged from 30° F - 45° F during rob marathon.

I ran a 48:XX minute 10K turkey trot last week, and so decided to set my pace for this run at 8:30-8:45 and ride it as long as possible. The first nearly 20 miles were perfect, as I was averaging a challenging but comfortable 8:25. 

Nearly at the 20 mile mark, my right adductor locked up. I’ve had this experience in the last two marathons and it sucks. I was able to recover after about a minute, but I had cramps in both my adductors at miles 22, 23, and 24. This was grueling as there was still a fair amount of race left and I was eating deeply into my time bank. 

After mile 24, I slowed my pace which prevented further cramps. Mile 24-26.2 were difficult and I was in a dark place worrying if I would make sub-4. I didn’t believe I would accomplish it until I turned the corner at mile 26 and saw the finish line. I tried picking up the pace but felt twinges again and didn’t want to recurrence of the cramps so I slowed down. I cross at 3:54:02, meeting all my goals and setting PRs for 15K, 20K, half marathon, 30K and marathon. "

# Training

I started running somewhat regularly back in August of 2022, however at that time I was not particularly committed (or addicted, I should say), so I typically just ran 8 to 12 miles a week. From August '22 all the way until September of '23, I never once exceeded 15 miles in a week.

That marked a change in my attitude as I tried to consistently hit higher mileage after that. I started to prioritize exercising more and more, so from September 2023 until February of 2024, my weekly mileage oscillated between 19 to 32 miles a week (although I only hit 30+ twice  during this time period)

By April of 2024 I had managed to start hitting 40 miles a week regularly. At this point my training became much more intentional - although perhaps not as effective as it could have been. I tried to incorporate weekly long runs as well as the occasional tempo or threshold run.

Unfortunately that lasted all of... 1 month. I dropped my mileage a ton during May 2024 and ended up getting a lingering hip injury that kept me from running almost the entire summer following.

At this point, I got pretty into Peloton, and started to regularly incorporate Peloton Power Zone classes into my weekly routine. Additionally, due to my schedule I have extra free-time in the Summer, so I started doing ""doubles"" with cross training (e.g 1 hour of treadmill, 1 hour biking).

I relied on RPE and heart rate to guide my efforts cross training - my primary focus was to maintain my fitness as much as possible. Fortunately, through extensive use of the Erg machine (rowing), the Elliptical, and in the Peloton, as well as the occasional aqua jog. I was able to generally manage 2 to 3 hours of exercise a day all Summer 2024.

It's worth mentioning that the only reason I had even started to get serious about exercise (running, before getting injured) was simply because I set the arbitrary goal to run a marathon on/near my 26th birthday (Late November). That *may* explain the sudden increase in intensity, consistency, and weekly mileage.

Anyway, I maintained consistent cross training as part of my regular routine from this point forward; even when returning to regular running (finally hitting 40 miles a week consistently again in late September '24). I did more research on actual plans and what sort of workouts to try and incorporate into my training. I took away lots of valuable information... and put into practice a small fraction of it.

Since October of '24, though more motivated, I was still not able to maintain 40+ miles a week for more than a month before needing to drop mileage substantially for a couple weeks at a time (although I was doing a SUBSTANTIAL amount of volume cross training to compensate) Suffice to say, I did not feel prepared for a marathon before the end of 2024. Knowing that I was ""failing"" my goal left me dealing with disappointment (and a non-insignificant amount of frustration) but came to terms with the fact that all the pressure I was experiencing was entirely placed upon myself; that running a marathon at a specific date or time was entirely arbitrary, and that I could simply... take more time to prepare before running. This prompted me to sign up for the Atlanta Marathon of this year.

Following this, I resolved to be consistent, even if it meant pushing through pains and discomforts that I would typically just let subside before resuming regular training (obviously not medical advice, please don't just read this and assume that's a good or smart decision - it's just all about knowing your body at the end of the day; I'm inclined to playing it safe, but there's lots more interesting conversation that could be had on this topic alone).

I ran the Polar Opposite Peachtree 10k January 2nd here in ATL. Initially, it was just intended as a tune-up workout, however I ended up running my 1 mile (6:07), 5k (19:46), and 10k (43:00) pb during the race. I felt pretty satisfied that I could perform well on a particularly hilly course. This deepened my resolve to train hard for the marathon (about 2 months away, at that point).

That more or less brings us to the race today - that being said, I will mention 3 things:

1. though my weekly mileage was low, I generally did about 8 to 12 hours of cardio a week - including the time spent running
2. I *almost* always did a long run each week - and averaged between 12 and 16 miles. I did manage to hit 20 miles one time (late January).
3. the area I run in is very hilly (in my opinion, at least - it's metro ATL, so I suppose it's all relative..)

I felt *somewhat* confident that I would be able to complete a marathon after that 20 mile long run (took about 2:44:00 to do) - but my lack of consistent high mileage, combined with having never practiced fueling or hydration during a run, I was certainly anxious the entire month of February as the marathon approached at an alarming pace.

I'll leave my ""training"" section there for now - I'm (all too) happy to further elaborate on more details if anyone is curious, though!

# Pre-race

I planned to get up a few hours before the race started so I could just get the blood flowing and get some food. I ate a plain bagel with peanut butter and honey, and like one clementine. Got ready and headed over to the race. An hour before the race I ate a banana.

After that I just moseyed my way on over the starting area and waited in the cold (just had a very thin singlet and janji half tights on, + gloves).

As for a plan... I really just didn't know what to expect. I mainly did not want to absolutely hit the wall and bonk and need to walk the last 10k. Beyond that... I just figured I'd feel it out as I went, although internally, I suspected somewhere around 8:00/mile on the fast side and 9:00 on the slower side would be the pace for me to settle into.

# Race

It was a cold day, but overall perfect weather for running. I was really only uncomfortable while waiting to start.

As we got going I felt pretty strong. I pretty much just started off at a pace that felt good and maybe perhaps possibly get a little carried away, as I covered the first 13.1 miles in 1:37:39. The logical side of me knew that this was too fast for a mull marathon, but I kinda decided to just not care and see how my body would handle that pace. After all, I felt strong and in control, so why not just send it?

This seemed like a prudent decision at the time... it was not. I don't know if I hit the ""wall"" exactly per se, as my cardio never felt particularly taxed, but my LEGS... entirely different story.

The race had 1500ft of elevation gain. Although there were hills pretty much the entire course, the first 8 miles were a net downhill. The rest of the course, however, was uphill with Atlanta's characteristic uncomfortably long gradual hills peppering pretty much each mile the whole way. No, I am *totally* not jealous of those who run in flatter areas, thanks for asking.

Anyways, I pretty much kept up this ""uptempo"" pace for the first 22 miles. By that point... my legs hurt more than I ever could have imagined. I also needed to pee pretty much the entire race - so there's that.

I did manage to get a few sips of Powerade and water throughout the race, but I didn't take any nutrition in terms of food or gels or candy, etc. etc.

Miles 22 through 24 were painful, but somehow manageable? I deluded myself into thinking that it wasn't really possible to hurt more than I did at that moment. This led me to a sort of zen acceptance of the pain I was in.

Unfortunately, this was a short lived enlightenment. By mile 25 all that pain made me slow to the point of essentially walking several times. I figured that if I could just make it to mile 25 that I would be able to finish strong.

That was... somewhat true, in hindsight. Although my last mile really did not feel like anything approaching my understanding of the word ""strong""

I ended up crossing the line in 3:25:28. However, I guess the course may have been a bit longer than that - as my watch/strava recorded my finishing time to be 2:25:09.

Some ""data"" for all those that it may interest:

* My heart-rate was low (about 150 bpm for the first few miles, but got up to 160 after that and it stayed between 160 to 165 the whole race, although I did briefly peak at 174 after one particular hill, towards the end of the race it went down again as my pace decreased drastically over the last 3 miles).
* cadence averaged 187 spm - pretty consistent throughout the entire race
* stride was 1.09m long, however it was about 1.12 until 22 miles, my stride started to shorten and become very inconsistent after that)
* Ground contact time: 235ms; not entirely sure if this actually matters, however like everything else, I was much more efficient over the first 22 miles

# Post-race

I immediately found the restroom. MY legs hurt and I walked with the confidence of an uncertain toddler. It was not a pretty site to see. To be honest I didn't feel the wave of strong emotions that I know some experience upon finish a marathon. It kinda just came and went. Honestly, if anything I'm glad it's over - I predict miles 24 - 26 will be in my legs all the rest of this week.

I'm uncertain if I want to continue to try training for marathons and get a fast time in on a flatter course or if maybe I just should focus on shorter distances. I definitely enjoy the 10k and half marathon distance more - I'm open to any advice, suggestions, feedback, or even opinions, while we're at it.

  
If you made it this far, thank you! This was as much a meditation for myself as a way to engage with the community - although I would truly appreciate any feedback or advice as towards what distance I should focus going forward and better ways to train."
1j7900t,2025-03-09 14:40:33+00:00,TheRunningPianist,,AdvancedRunning,/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1j7900t/tokyo_marathon_race_report/,Tokyo Marathon Race Report,"I got into the Tokyo Marathon via charity, and this is probably the easiest way to get in if you don’t have the qualifying times. It’s not a guarantee, though, as some of the charities get a lot of applicants and a good proportion of them are only open to residents of Japan, but your chances are still much better than the lottery. Also, the amount you will need to raise is usually much lower than that for most of the other World Majors; your acceptance is contingent on the amount you pledge, but for my charity, whose mission was to make sports more accessible across Japan, ¥200,000, or about $1,350, was enough to get me in.

The Tokyo Marathon was my fourteenth marathon, my first international race of any distance, and my third World Major after Chicago in 2014 and Boston in 2017 and 2018. I finished in 3:09:16 (4:30/km or 7:13/mile)—not a personal best or a Boston qualifying time, but certainly not my worst. And it was a time I was happy with, especially considering my less-than-diligent training, all the unknowns that come with flying across the globe for a race, and everything that has been going on in my life ever since the inauguration of that thing in the White House.

**Training**

I ran six days a week and got in a few 50+ mile weeks. My maximum of 53 miles wasn’t too far off from my Richmond Marathon training cycle in 2023. But in general, let’s just say I wasn’t exactly crushing it in training this time.

First, my training cycle was shorter than usual; whereas I usually like to train for fourteen or fifteen weeks, this time, the cycle was only twelve weeks long. After the Richmond Half-Marathon in November, I wanted to take a three-week break before starting to train for Tokyo; had I done my usual fifteen weeks, I would have had to start right after Richmond. I thought twelve weeks would have been adequate and that taking the time to recharge would have been worth the shorter training cycle, but what ended up happening was that I felt rushed in trying to hit the weekly mileage that I wanted; I had some jumps in mileage that were a little higher than what most people recommend. Plus, I usually like to do a tune-up half-marathon or ten-mile race during the training cycle, but with the compressed schedule, there was no time for that (and there’s also the issue of half-marathons being very uncommon on the east coast in January and February).

And the number of runs I did that were faster than easy pace? Six across the entire twelve weeks: a 15K race during the first week, two tempo runs at the end of January, neither of which were more than four miles, and three marathon-pace runs of four or five miles, the first of which I failed. Washington, DC had its snowiest winter in a while and the bulk of my training took place when there were several inches of snow or sheets of ice on the ground—not exactly conducive to tempo runs or marathon-pace runs.

So when race day approached, I accepted that I wasn’t going to break the marathon world record this time around, but I didn’t have reason to believe this would be an unmitigated disaster either. I decided I would target 3:09:00 to 3:12:00—a range that I would be happy with but wasn’t a reach goal—and that I would focus on enjoying the experience of being in a country I never visited before, especially after weather forecasts were calling for temperatures in the high fifties at the start and mid-sixties by the time I finished.

**Race Day**

The course is primarily confined to downtown Tokyo, starting near Shinjuku and consisting of several out-and-back segments before ending near Tokyo Station and the Imperial Palace. The first several miles are a steady downhill and the rest of the course is relatively flat, aside from a few overpasses that actually aren't too bad at all.

But still, even if the weather were ideal, I wouldn't say that the Tokyo Marathon is an ideal choice for any reach goals, especially if you don't live in Japan. It's not that the course is actually particularly challenging; the difficulty here comes from the sum of a lot of little things, including having to walk over a mile to the start line, how crowded it is during the first few miles, and, for those coming in from another country, all the variables that come with international travel and adjusting to a different time zone. It's certainly not impossible to run a good race in Tokyo, but I might not count on it to be one of your best.

But anyway, as for the race itself,

* My first mile was 8:01, mostly because I couldn't move with how tightly packed we all were at the beginning.
* I ran mostly by feel because GPS was largely unreliable, most likely due to all the tall buildings on the route (my Garmin indicated I covered 27.1 miles in total).
* I started feeling a little warm about five kilometers in and tried running in the shade whenever possible. I felt it in my quads starting at around the 25K mark, and that's when I knew that the last few miles might be tough.
* I stuck with my usual fueling plan: drink water or sports drink at every station and eat one gel every twenty minutes or so, and do this until I reach the 30K mark, after which I don't eat or drink anything at all.
* I really had to dig deep at around 35K, but I managed to keep a reasonably steady pace all the way to the finish line and ended up running a moderate negative split (1:35:46/1:33:30; I am unable to post mile-by-mile splits like I usually do because of how wonky GPS was).
* I beat Harry Styles by about fifteen minutes.

And a note about the water stops: Tokyo Marathon did something unusual in that runners were requested to only take water from the table associated with the last digit of their bib number (i.e., if your bib number was 10960, you were requested to take water from the 9/0 table). It was certainly an interesting idea to relieve potential congestion at the water stations, but it was a real collision course with everyone weaving in and out, particularly earlier in the race. It may have been because runners were not used to dealing with something like this. But if I had one suggestion, it would be to use both sides of the course; all the tables were lined up on the left side at every water station. Perhaps the 1/2, 5/6, and 9/0 tables could be placed on the left side of the course and the 3/4 and 7/8 tables on the right.

As for my overall assessment of the race, it was a positive experience and I'm glad I did it, but this doesn't even come close to being my favorite marathon. Before the race, I told the two other members of my running club that were also doing the Tokyo Marathon that I had a feeling that the race was not going to be the highlight of the trip. Honestly, I was more excited about our day trip to Kyoto the following day and our whirlwind tour of Tokyo the day after, and both of those ended up being more memorable. I wouldn't be averse to doing the Tokyo Marathon again, but if I were to come to Japan in the future to do another race (which I had seriously been considering, if only as an excuse to come back), I would probably look for something else.

**Future Plans**

After the Cherry Blossom 10-Miler in early April, my racing season is essentially over. Since I didn't get into the New York City Marathon this time around, I think I will focus on speed and shorter distances in the fall, especially since I've grown to like weightlifting and track workouts quite a lot and have grown a little tired of marathon training. But another marathon most certainly isn't out of the question; given that I ran a 1:24:01 during my last half-marathon, I don't think a sub-3:00 marathon is unattainable to me. Provided I could keep up that kind of half-marathon time, in 2026, there's a good chance I'll be willing to try for sub-3:00 in a smaller race with easier logistics in which I will have better control over all the variables."

I ran the Galveston Marathon yesterday and finished the race at a 12 minute mile pace, 5:14 minutes of running/walking. I finished the first half of the marathon @ 2:21:00



I had two goals going into the race, first being just to finish and second to finish under 5 hours. Race strategy was to follow a 10/10/10 - which is reserve energy on the first 10 miles, pick up speed in the second 10 miles, then just finish in the last 10km. 

**Prior running experience:** 

Last year in February I tried to jump into the Hal Higdon novice 1 plan, I got to the half mile mark then decided I needed to lose weight before proceeding. I went from 235 lbs->210 lbs over the course of the last year prior to starting training. 



**Notes on training:**

I started the same Hal Higdon novice 1, I followed it fairly closely except for two weeks. I got very sick during the peak of training (20 mile run week), so I was only able to complete the 20 mile run instead of the 40 miles that week prescribed. During my last taper week I hated the idea of only running 1-2 miles, so instead I biked to work two days that week (40 miles biking total). Biking to work is something I was doing at the beginning of my training plan, but had to stop towards the middle of it due to weather and the amount of time I was spending running. Most of my training was in mild temperature 40-70 degrees, and all long runs were during cooler days. 

Overall, I felt really good during training. Some of the long runs didn't phase me and I'd feel like I had more in the tank (except for 18 & 20). I also was finding it progressively more difficult to stay within the pace I had originally set out for most training runs (11 minute miles). I also had originally planned to run the Houston marathon 3 weeks earlier, but could not get a spot, so I ended up doing three weeks 2X over as I had to realign my training plan.



**Race day & route conditions:** 

Honestly the conditions were not what I was hoping for. The morning started in the low 60s(f) but after the first 13 miles it was fully 75, 100% humidity and sunny. About 4 miles of the entire route were on sand, I didn't know this going in but didn't mind since my feet were never an issue despite being on them for 5+ hours. The route was s 13.1 mile loop, so I ran the course twice.



**Race day consumption:**

8 Gu packets

10 lbs of water

1 can of coke (half a can at mile 18 and 23) 

pickle juice shots on the back half of the marathon



**Whoop heart rate zones:**

Zone 5: 0:22

Zone 4: 2:50 (!!)

Zone 3: 1:35 

Zone 2: 0:37



**Experience:**

just to further clarify on the disclaimer above - my strava over exaggerates the distance I run, so I didn't rely on it for pacing. In retrospect I wish I had enabled the mile announcer feature so that I could have at least had an idea of how long I had been running.... but more on that later. 



I really feel like I ran two races between the first 13.1 and the second 13.1, one was excellent and as planned and the other was a terrible slog. I was maintaining a 10:53 pace for the first 6 miles which was a little slower than I had planned then picked up in the next 7 to finish the half at a 10:46 pace. This was in line with my 10/10/10 plan, and my training plan which said to run 30-90 seconds faster per mile on race day. First half I felt mostly good, my legs were super fresh from the taper, but I could tell my heart rate was elevated and that I was sweating way more than usual. I want to say I was hydrating enough during the first half as it was cooler, but I'm not sure. Around mile 8 I started filling up my two 10 oz water bottles at every aid station(2 miles apart), finishing them in the next two miles and then refilling them. That morning I had been trying to watch the 4:40 pacer as much as possible, recognizing that I'd slowly watch the stick get farther and farther away and I was very happy with that. As I crossed the half way mark, I saw the time on the clock showing 2:34 - this demoralized me a bit, but in actuality the time on the clock had just started prior to me running (as my course time crossing this mark was 2:21)



The second half is where things got really difficult. Around mile 16 my quads tightened up (felt like bricks), and I could tell my body temperature was way too high. My first walk happened here & I took my shirt off to cool down. At this point, I hit an emotional low point, I hadn't expected to struggle at mile 16, during all my previous long runs I had coasted to this point. Struggling early & the heat made me really question if I should pursue completion or just try again another day. But then I started run/walking as best as I could, walking for part of a mile then running the rest. My focus was on staying cool and staying in the race, and I was still ahead of the 5:00 pacer, so I felt confident that I had margin to walk some. I started taking two cups of pickle juice at each aid station in addition to filling up my water bottles, and had my support crew bring me some coke at miles 18 and 23 - this helped me stay in it. At mile 23, support crew had two cold water bottles and I asked them to pour them on me, this really changed the game and I was able to run way longer than the previous stretch of miles (20-23). Miles 23-26 I finished pretty well despite some calf cramping (also never experienced this before race day), some of my support crew ran alongside me & I still didn't see the 5:00 pacer so I felt like the race was a win on both goals. 



Finishing this marathon felt so satisfying, despite slogging through a warm day and not running how I had wanted to, I am very happy with the experience. It turns out the 5:00 pacer was struggling with the heat as well, she crossed the finish line about 5 minutes after me (5:20). Not hitting the 5:00 goal disappointed me a little, but I think the heat was partially to blame so I'm not worrying about it too much. I can't even complain too much about the 5:00 pacer finishing behind me because I spent every ounce of energy I had to finish that race. 



**Takeaways:**

1. For future races, I need to get a Garmin so I can feel more confident in my pacing and also be able to see my heart rate as I'm running. I have my whoop but getting onto the app while running is a bit of a pain.

2. I should have thrown my strategy out the window when I saw the weather report. I should have decided to go slower than my training runs during the first half, maybe target 11:15 min/mile for the first ten and 11:00 min/mile for the second ten. 

3. Another Marathon may not be the next goal, I really enjoyed training and progressing and I feel like training for 5/10ks and half marathons will give me a little more immediate feedback. I also like the idea of trying to get my per mile faster before starting another marathon training plan.

4. I need to embrace running in the heat, I had avoided it for the most part and it caught up with me. Reading online, it seems like the body can adapt to it in a matter of weeks, but I was really focused on hitting training goals and didn't want to jeopardize that with a warm run. 

5. Weight loss doesn't happen during training, and I shouldn't have counted on it. I was really hoping to get to 200 lbs before race days, but I did not get close to that.

## Training

I've been a lifelong runner since high school but had slowly given up any focused training or distances as life got in the way through my 20s and 30s. As with so many others, I began to run more and more during  COVID, signing up for my first 10 miler and half marathon races in many years in 2021-2022. As my running improved, I also connected with 2 local running groups and saw dramatic improvements through weekly track sessions and through discovering new running routes. On a trip to Disney World with my daughter in 2022, we saw the Run Disney events and I decided to run my first marathon back in January 2023. It was the best thing I had ever done for myself and I was hooked. Despite 2 injuries that began with non running related mistakes, I finished in 3:27 and was very proud of myself but knew I had more in me. I wanted to go for a BQ, 3:10. I knew that would likely not get me into Boston, but it was a goal that felt meaningful and achievable.

The Richmond Marathon is a close, medium sized, well run event with full support and is the big event that a lot of my community trains for, so I knew that would be my next big race. I started training in July and was eagerly ramping up my miles until a backpacking trip out west with my brother where we hiked 70 miles at high altitude with 50 lbs packs. I think it mostly helped except for the last day with a huge decent that injured my achiles. The latter half of August and early September was spent following PT and doing lower mileage with no speed work. Finally better, I ramped up both speed and distance, making my way up to 60 miles/week without injury, and hovering around that distance for several weeks. My longest run of 22 miles felt fantastic. My pace runs were a solid B, getting close to hitting my pace marks without feeling too beaten up afterwards. My main focus during most of my training was to stay at conversational pace for all of my runs except track workouts and every 2nd week pace runs. Except for the injury hiatus, I was feeling good and mostly confident.

## Pre-race

The week before my race ended up being a lot more stressful than I'd wished for, as some work projects threw me for a loop and my parents ending up in the hospital, necessitating lots of late nights and errand running. My sleep was poor and stress was high. Despite the issues, everyone turned out OK and my wife and kiddo and I drove to Richmond the night before. I got a decent night's sleep and woke up eager to run.

## Race

I went out between my target pace group, 3:10, and my previous PR group 3:25, after following advice from my coach to start slow. I wish I'd followed his advice more closely, because I went out at 7:18 when I was targeting 7:30-35. As is so often the case- the fun race day vibes just make that tough!

The course was absolutely beautiful and the weather was perfect. 39F at the start and warming up to mid 40s for the duration of the race. I made it to the 3:10 pace group by the 13 mile mark and was feeling fantastic as our time was about 10 seconds faster than a 3:10 finish, just about perfect. I was planning on sticking with them until about mile 17, after the one long hill on the course. That hill came and was not nearly as tough as I had put into my mind. However, I was still running cautiously and stayed with them. At mile 19 the pacers gave us a lot of encouragement, saying that this is when people fade, but I was still feeling good and thinking about making a go for it to try to get my A goal of 3:07. However, by mile 22 I definitely started to feel it. The limiting factor ended up being my quads, which began to feel like dense balls of pain, and miles 23-26 were a real struggle. My spirit faded as the 3:10 pace group slowly got further away from me. I passed the finish line and didn't know my exact time until the notification text came with 3:10:07.

## Post-race

This race has given me the most varied emotions I've ever felt. On the one hand, I am extremely proud and happy with a 17 minute PR. However, missing my BQ by 7 seconds stings. I'm still processing it and am trying my hardest not to throw too big of a pity party. I know I've got those 7 seconds in me. But the taxing marathon training months and the soreness in my quads are making me question my next steps. I think I have another one in me for March or April 2024, but need to focus on physical recovery and mental healing first. Future training will probably add more strength work and more pace work, I'm comparing various plans now. I think the mantra of ""doing easy miles easy"" helped me a lot, as my endurance felt really good even as my legs gave out.

Thank you to everyone in this sub for reading and for all of the support that you give.

\### Training

I trained on my aerobic base starting October (had not ran a race since 2019 and never trained for one, including in 2019, and never ran more than 21kms at that point but was doing cardio and generally athletic) and signed up for the Marathon in my home city Paris.

The aerobic base training went well, I still did Pilates, yoga, strength training but added more than the previous Sunday 7 km jog and tried to be consistent with 3/4 easy runs per week.

Starting december, I followed the 3h45 plan offered by the Schneider Electrics Marathon team and put the recommended runs in my Garmin calendar. I had no issue putting in the time to run but since the start had issues with sticking to the plan / matching the needed speed. I am a slow runner. I hate sprinting, it feels like my legs are made of lead, I don't understand how to run faster (even though logically I know speed work / fartlek + higher mileage is the key but a girl can dream and have it happen without putting in the work right ? ... Yes, I read all your post and watched all the Youtube content of BPN, Runwise, SallyMcRae and Stephen Scullion but pffft, following it ?

Anyway, I slugged through the plan and have to say I always took more time to recover from a speed workout, never really hit the target speed and just ... enjoyed running outside, most of the interval / speed works being swapped for generic Z2 training with just a few 100 m sprints in the middle and at the end.

Did it bite me in the end ? Possibly.

I knew it did not run enough (around 30/40 kms a week) and not enough specific workout and too many easy runs but somehow I hate speed work precisely because I can never be able to maintain speed for more than mere seconds. Also hit my peak form too early, around January did a HM unofficial training run around 1:38 then caught a mean flu that stopped me two weeks and general tardiness / mental fatigue accumulated but excuses are always dime a dozen.

Felt fairly confident I could finish the Marathon going ahead by pure stubborness and pride but still clung to a magical thinking of running sub 4h.

\### Pre-race

I woke up at 6h30 fully awaken after a good night sleep, tried to carbo load with no luck (could not eat any carbs the day before and even my lovely candies did not appeal to me) with oats and full grain rice with barbecue sauce (I love gluten but it is an unrequited love so did not want to push my chances with GI issues and had no idea what to eat that was carb heavy w/o a lot of gluten and yet familiar), plus 3 SIS gels between 7:30 and 9:20 AM. Also took meds : ercefuryl, immodium and doliprane before the start because my worst fear is having a GI issue during a public (or private ahah) event.

Race was very well organized (and that's coming from a run of the mill complaining French person) and signaled.

The start was around Arc de Triomphe, quite a few runners on the metro line 1 all excited, in group or family, and in the vicinity of the starting line so felt the energy.

My corral call was 9h49 but decided to show up around 8h30 as I was afraid of what 55 000 people could look like for the metro and organization and did have a impressive bag to put to the free lockers provided by the race org.

(NB: why did I pack my massage ball, my micellar water, hand towel, kinésiotherapie tape, extra gels, SPF, lip balm etc in my bag for the after race but did not think to pack an extra pair of socks and sandals to relieve my sore feets after the race is beyond me)

Gave the bag with my bib tag to the volunteers (so many of them, so nice, will volunteer next year) and even had 30 minutes to go to a nearby café and enjoy darjeeling tea, people watching and going to the loo with soap and TP included ahahah) as well as call my boyfriend to distract myself from the stress.

Entered the corral at 9h30 with full length legging, T shirt, a Kway and cap and did well because it was a bit chilly for my taste and we had to wait 1h in the corral (and I am always cold so would have died had I been like every other in their flimsy T shirt) before gun time.

\### Race

Debuted racing at 10:46 AM, was feeling heavy from the get go, you know when it is one of ""those"" runs and you will have to just push through ? Except now it is not 5 kms ahead of you but a full Marathon ? So I prevailed by focusing on other people choice of baskets, caps, T shirt and running vest.   (this is not especially a ""do it like I did"" race report, ahem)

Notes to potential market analysts : the 4hOO crowd loves Asics and Hoka, not so much Nike and On and I did not see more than a few Mizuno, Puma or Adidas. Under armour absolutely lost this market share. Lot of faded colors and bright yellow and pink pastel. An ungodly amount of bum shorts (some with frills and froufrous, don't judge me, I parisian judge like it's an olympic sport) and OMG, people can actually rock Oakley and Roka sunglasses or do they just downgrade Apollon and Venus to just normal good looking people ? Anyways.

The first 5 kms were easy as even with my subpar sensations, the scenery was just so nice and the energy and music so vivid that it felt like mere minutes happened.

I felt ok till 12 km even if I was already not at my desired 5:30/km pace but decided to try for negative splits (spoiler.. :'( ) and not burn myself too early. I had to undo my Kway and McGyver a way to tie it at my waist without offuscating my bib (liste, I don't know if I am live tracked by a pin or by my visual bib but I fully knew I did not come this far to only come this far and be disqualified for a technicality)

The stalls with water, bananas, bread, fruits and other were plentiful and well manned. No complaints. I tried to have 2 gels per hour but only managed 1 SIS gel and 1 quarter banana each hour, with great difficulty. Sipped on my electrolyte water consciously all the race though.

We entered Bois de Vincennes km 12 and suddenly the crowd vanished and the mental focus was on ... on my left psoas and left hip that began to just slighty bothering me. Also the fact that I made my own caravan but was my only camel with my running vest, running belt, K way tied up, 2 waterpouchs and 10 gels, and phone and meds and lip balm.

Till km24 We (as in the not royal we) pushed through but at km 24/25 I knew I definitely did not have it in me to either negative split nor possibly finish this marathon.

I used my last joker and called my boyfriend with no luck, then my twin sister (not second best, I you read me). She answered and told me that she was on her way to surprise at km34 and I KNEW I could not give up at least until km34.01.

So on the self administered rallying call of ""les excuses c'est pour les foufettes"" -excuses are for lazies- I registered every excruciating km as Xkm before km 34 to distract from the increased perceived difficulty, seeing people I told myself I would stick to go pass me in a breeze and disappear in the faster unknown and generally feeling like I should have stick to HM.

The mental strain did not improve and I honestly only remember readjusting my goals to ""do not DNF"" and ""do not walk"" (oh, to plan and have the Gods laugh) at some point around km 24/26. I do remember some slight elevation and generally knowing that I did not want to walk because I could no longer trust myself not to stop entirely if that happened.

I saw my sister at km34 and honestly she made me so happy. She even ran with me for 200 m (as in, after having given birth 1 month and a half ago she actually ran faster that I walked - and I could not muster more energy out of my thighs) and told me all the right things to give it one more kilometer and reassess.

I honestly was not expecting any supporter but that made a difference. And I also wailed on the phone with my boyfriend who proceeded to call me every 20 minutes for a few minutes and distract me at my request with tales of his day. I might be working on mental toughness but dignity took a holiday yesterday.

Km 34 to 38 were my new definition of Hell constructed by egregiously privileged people who do not know how well we won the universe lottery. I repeatedly told myself that this was a purely self inflicted pain to discover mental toughness when life gave me a golden ticket to peace, security and health. I walked a bit and tried to regroup with my platoon of 1 but when I look at data see my pace going from 6:55 to 7:09.

I do not want to talk about how much I walked between km38 and 40. Let's say that of there was no public, I could have gone to MacDonalds. Also reminded myself that my house key was on my deposited bag so had to crawl back anyway.  
I discovered that not only do the universe expand or contracts but time spent on the asphalt running has a similar propriety to curiously slow down starting km24 and seconds become hours and reverse

My mom later told me that whilst looking at my time live on the app (once again, well made since she could find me. She is lovely but not the most techy) she feared I was about to stop between km 38 and 40. So did I mum, so did I.

km 40.5 My sister was once again a champ and showed up by yelling my very specific name and I turned my head and saw her and decided to run till the end with a newfound energy.

The last 2 kms were downhill and packed with thousands of supporters and music and views and so I ran again till the end.

Final official time (my Garmin and Strava were ahead of the time due to my inability to run in straight line) is 4h24:35.

\### Post-race

Very smooth to get my bag, got offered an apple and yet other bananas, called my boyfriend, met with my sister, word vomited for the first yet not last time my experience during race.

My left buttock, hip and psoad were sore as was my thigh. No cramps or GI issue so was happy.

I paid my lack of follow trough on the plan, was punished by my magical thinking and everything I knew could happen happened and I bunked severely, walking for 14 minutes according to Garmin/ Strava, mostly around km 30 and 39. I kept repeating my self ""tu peux le faire"" et ""c'est un privilège de faire ca"" and counting the distance by humble distance I knew I could manage. I also forced myself to smile, look ahead and remind myself that I was running in a beautiful city, full of life, peace and good air and that the whole experience was a joy and a great day in life, and fully believing it even though I ugly cried on the phone.

All in all, it was an humbling experience, so much admiration for the athletes, those that crushed it at 2h09 as well as all the seniors passing right through me with their grey mane and amazing spirit and those that suffered even more than me. I don't think I will run a marathon again but am definitely looking at a HM in November so... who knows ?

Tip : do not look at the videos your sister took of you after the race, it was ... discovering a new set of bad angles.

# Training

I’ve been a runner my whole life. Before this race, the most seriously I took it was a handful of competitive 800m races in high school and university. I ran the [Great Ocean Road Marathon](https://greatoceanroadrunfest.com.au/) in my first year out of university, but it was a social pursuit with a friend, and I didn’t set any targets. My training block peaked at 60km / week. Most weeks since then, I’ve run between 2-3 times a week to stay fit. 

Two years ago, I was between jobs and needed something to occupy my time. I was living in Amsterdam and came across the wonderful community website called [Mud Sweat Trails](https://www.mudsweattrails.nl/). They maintain a list of 15-35km trail runs that can be accessed by the reliable Dutch rail network. You can upload your GPX file after completing the run (along with a selfie in front of the clock at the departure and arrival station, for verification), and they’ll add you to the local leaderboard. Running through these quaint, tranquil Dutch national parks, I fell in love with running again. It morphed from a routine to a passion. 

I’d established a good baseline and toyed with the idea of running a serious marathon. The main goal was to hit a time that would convince any (future) children I was once fit. I booked the Yorkshire Marathon for later that year (2024) and set my training block parameters using a half marathon time trial where I’d nudged under 1h19. Unhelpfully, I had three months of travel, wedding, and honeymoon festivities before I started my block. 

Returning slightly less fit and with limited time to draft a plan, I succumbed to the Runna marketing. I’m certain this is r/advancedrunning sacrilege, but… I bloody loved it. The best plan is the one you stick to, and the varied workouts, calendar integrations, watch syncing, and schedule adjustments make that very easy. I also have a tricky relationship with social media, and any time not spent on Strava is good for me (ironic given today’s news..). 

I hadn’t done any pacework since university, and I loved my mornings at the Parliament Hill and Regent’s Park running tracks. There is a particular rush when completing 10+ repeats at max pace that I don’t get from my long runs, or even time trials. Things were looking rosy until 6 weeks out when I decided to squeeze 6 days of workouts into 3, and my knee significantly inflamed. I couldn’t walk properly for a week, and it was clear I was out for the marathon. I went to two different physios and got two different opinions (was it tendonitis? was it a cartilage issue?). Ultimately, I needed stronger quads and hamstrings, and I spent the next 3 months confined to the gym, alternating between the leg raisers, squat machine, and treadmill. Thank goodness for Technogym; the virtual tours of Barcelona, Costa Brava, and Joshua Tree helped preserve some sanity. 

In January, I could finally run outside pain-free. It felt amazing. Three friends had signed up for Paris, and another had pulled out, so there was a spot going spare. I committed. I ran a 5km time trial (16:25) to confirm my fitness was on track, and then replicated my previous training plan. This time, I added daily resistance band exercises. I felt no pain; the stronger muscles did the trick. 

With so much anticipation, I had more time to worry and question my target. One of my friends ran 2:36 at London last year. When I shared my target, and that my training plan peaked at 80km / week, he said I was dreaming and needed 25% more mileage. I was running 4 times a week: one easy run, one long run (often with intervals), and 1-2 tempo runs (often over/under 🥵). I’d heard rumours that due to a spate of injured subscribers, in winter 24/25 Runna had chosen to lower the default mileage. In my case, my plan was 10% lower than before; hard to confirm the rumours, but it did sow doubt. Nevertheless, I ploughed through with my plan and did not make it past page 50 of Daniel’s running formula, shared generously by my friend. 

My peak training week was week 10 of 14. It culminated in a 36km long run, of which 27km were at target marathon pace (3:50). At the 25km mark I was feeling great and bumped it to sub 3:45. I went an additional 4km and hit 2:33 over the full 40km. At that pace, I was on track for 2:40. This was the first time my target felt possible. I managed my expectations there, as I’d only done 80m elevation, compared with the \~290m in store. 

# Pre-race

My taper week was a battle to avoid catching the cold that my wife and colleagues had fallen victim to. Oranges, ginger, and early nights kept it at bay. My hypochondriac senses remained heightened, and every sniffle or dry throat felt like a threat to my looming goal. We travelled to Paris mid-week to acclimatise and make more of the trip. It is a gorgeous place to be in April, but a terrible place to carb-load. I made do with a diet of baguettes and pastries, with one ill-advised trip to a malatang restaurant—let’s just say the Szechuan de-loaded my carb stores. 

I did my last shake out on the Friday (the second voyage of my Endorphin Elites) and my body felt strong.

# Race

I’d secured a spot in the sub-elite group (2h30-3h), which was much busier than expected. It felt like 500 of us were anxiously jostling in the holding pen. I caught sight of the 2h40 pacers, but we were separated by a sea of contestants. With 15 minutes until the starting gun and 500mL of water filtering through my body, I had other priorities. The queue to the 4-man urinal was 50 people long and moving at snail’s pace. Camaraderie triumphed, hygiene failed, and it became an 8-man urinal. With 20 seconds to go, I finally cleared my bladder. 

The first 2km was a soup of nerves and testosterone. I took the outside track to avoid the chaos in the middle of the road, and slowly things started to calm down. I was hitting 3:35-3:40 and knew I needed to check myself. I gradually dropped to 3:50 and at km 4, I heard a stampede at my tail. I turned to see the two 2:40 pacers followed by 50 people. I’d heard enough horror stories of the hills at the end of the course to know that negative splits should be the goal. Save the energy until you’re sure your legs have it. I moved aside and joined the back of the pack, slowly dropping back but keeping them within eyesight. 

I let the gap grow to \~30 seconds by the 15km mark, taking me through the first set of the Bois de Vincennes’ gentle hills. As we returned toward the city, we confronted the 16kph south westerly, and I recognised the benefit of drafting. I pushed and rejoined the 2:40 pack, where I remained for the next 10km. Perhaps unsurprising, but the pacing of the pacers was impeccable. I’d written the 2h40 5km splits on my arm, and we entered each of the 15, 20, and 25km markers within 10 seconds of the target. It’s remarkable how well they did despite the hills, turns, narrowing streets, and drink station malarkey. 

Ascending back into the city was the first challenge to morale, but it was short-lived. I regained belief as we approached Place de la Bastille. As we passed the monument, I was overwhelmed by emotion in a way I’d never experienced while running. It was primarily intense endorphins, but they were amplified by the incessant cheers from the crowd, the recent sighting of my wife (for the impressive second time), the *fraternité* of the selfless pacer at my side, and a particular sequence of piano chords (1:31:45 of [this Job Jobse set](https://soundcloud.com/jobjobse/dagen-van-diamant)). I cried with a big, ugly, grimace on my face for the next minute. 

It was still too early for this level of confidence, so I remained with the pack for the next 5km. The biggest issue with pack running was the drink stations. I was optimising for as many 100mL swigs as possible, which meant sprinting ahead at each station to avoid a disastrous clash. By km 30, I still felt strong. The views of the Seine added a morale boost and the descent blocked the wind, eliminating any benefits of drafting. I pushed ahead and started hitting sub-3:45. 

The next 5km I fell into a great rhythm at 3:40-3:45 with a fellow contestant. In my high school French, we exchanged our targets and agreed to stick together. Doing split math is hard enough in English, but I believe I expressed that his 2:35 ambition was slightly unrealistic unless we really picked up the pace. His confidence was nonetheless inspiring. Unfortunately, the hills in the park took their toll on both of us, but somehow to my new companion more than to me. We parted ways before the 35km mark. It was just me and DJ Heartstring for the last push. 

Having read several Paris race reports, I think a major benefit of the sub-3h group is the limited exposure to victims of Bois de Boulogne. I saw three fellow runners bonk in that last 5km, and it hurt every time. My memory of kilometers 37-40 is hazy. My mental energy was focused on consuming my last gel, which I’d nursed for 2km, and my legs were in a state of pain-drenched autopilot. The last climb to Trocadéro was the toughest of all, but again the Parisian supporters came through. I can’t compare them to other marathon crowds, but the enthusiasm in their shouting reminded me of Tour de France footage. It was deeply infectious. From there it was an all-out sprint downhill. I struggle to imagine a more picturesque or satisfying marathon finish. 

# Post race / what’s next

I’ve been on a high ever since. That said, I don’t know if there’s another marathon on the horizon for me. This was a unique sense of satisfaction, and I expect there would be diminishing marginal satisfaction in shaving more minutes off my PB. I can’t imagine recreating the experience of achieving that milestone, in such a beautiful spot, with such a great crew. I’d also not expect my wife to hit metro tunnel- and lime bike-PBs to support me at so many spots along the course.  

But that’s my unique perspective, and it’s said while my quads refuse to transport me up or down the stairs. "

## History

This is my third installment (and marathon) of endurance running after being diagnoses with Multiple Sclerosis. In 2017 I was diagnosed with MS - almost 8 years ago to the day of the Boston Marathon, when I woke up one morning unable to feel temperature in my right leg and significant weakness throughout my left side. As part of facing my new reality, I knew I needed to focus on fitness and getting healthier, two things proven to help slow the progression of the disease. It was a slow process of ramping up mileage and starting to adapt to running again, and about two years ago I ran my first Half Marathon as a training run, aiming to be near 1:45. I remember at that time thinking how incredibly difficult that run was, and wondering if I could ever run a marathon. Nevertheless, I started training and eventually ran my first marathon last May, the Vermont City Marathon in a time of 3:26. I had a great time, and was fortunate to get a charity bib for the Berlin Marathon in September, completing that in a time of 3:08. Earlier in the year, I had decided that I wanted to try and run Boston, knowing I was pretty far away from a BQ but recognizing that I was in decent shape and with an uncertain future - I signed up as an Adaptive Athlete as part of the Para Athlete program. This involved submitting documentation of my MS diagnosis and some info on my ""qualifier"", a different criterium than the standard BQ process. I figured that I should try and run Boston now, while I still can run, as I could have another MS flare at any time and lose the ability to run.

## Training

After Berlin I was feeling in pretty good shape, despite a bout of Post-tibial Tendonitis that sidelined me for about 3 weeks (I hobbled across the finish line and could barely walk for the next 4-5 days). As I eased back into running, I raced my first ever HM on a hilly course with a time of 1:29:22. This was my first sub-90 HM, which I was pretty pleased with despite coming off of injury. I continued to base build, running about 40-50mpw for the rest of 2024, thinking that maybe...just maybe...I could shoot for sub-3 at Boston. Going into 2025, I decided to try and do Pfitz 18/70; I really enjoy the discipline required for the Pfitz plan, previous doing the 12/55 then 18/55 plans for my first two marathons. I found that the increased mileage was a lot to deal with and in hindsight I wasn't quite ready for it. I hit a few weeks of 65+ miles before developing some tendonitis issues in my right hamstring and right ankle that massively sidetracked my training for the rest of the block.

Around the time of my injury I also came down with the flu, when I recovered I stupidly did a big week and blew up. My ankle was shot. I tried to take a few weeks easy, decreasing my mileage, while starting PT. I found that if I dropped the speedwork I was able to ease into my runs and at least keep some of the volume up. For me, this was a big frustration because I really need to push speedwork and strength training to keep my MS symptoms at bay. I am very prone to neuromuscular fatigue, and if I don't keep at the speedwork then I have a lot of neurological issues with my left leg in particular. Still, I was able to run a bit, and that was enough to keep some of the training in motion. Over the course of the block my weekly mileage was 47, 56, 56, 60, 64, 63, 50 (flu), 40, 67, 44, 14 (injury), 55, 54, 52, 58, 46, 40, 26, 18. By this point I had mostly given up on Pfitz, even the 18/55 plan, and was just loosely following it and running on vibes.

About 1-1.5 months out from Boston I had to make a decision: drop my goal of a PR and maybe sub-3, or try to push through the injury and see if my increased strength and fitness + PT will give me enough of an edge to recover into the taper. I chose to run through the injury. Four weeks out, I ran my longest run of the block, 23 miles at around a 7:10 pace and started to introduce some light speed work. It felt pretty good and I found once I warmed up I could run through the ankle pain without it getting much worse. Three weeks out, I ran a 21 mile long run with about 12 at MP through the Newton Hills. This felt pretty good, albeit a very tough workout. Two weeks out I raced a 15K tune-up racing, netting a new 10K PR of 38:25 and an overall time of 58:35. I was feeling pretty good, I was maybe on track for sub-3 pace, even though my weekly mileage was a bit low. I started a pretty hard taper, hoping my injuries would resolve by race day.


## Pre-Race

I live in the Boston area, so things were pretty easy for me. I respond very well to high carb fueling, and started loading on Friday with 600g of carbs. Saturday I took in 700g of carbs, and as a shakeout I ran the BAA 5K with some friends. It was a great atmosphere and I kept it pretty easy, 2 miles at MP. Sunday I didn't run at all, and consumed about 600g of carbs. I went to bed around 9:30pm and woke up at 3:30am, unable to sleep any longer. I ate a banana and a bagel and drove into Boston at 6am to catch the bus over to Hopkinton. Time to go for broke - hit my time or die trying.

## Race

Because of my ""Adaptive Athlete"" status, I was automatically put into Wave 1 Corral 8. This ended up working out pretty well for me, as I was aiming for around a 3hr marathon, which was right on pace for this group. The weather was good, not great - I'd say maybe a 7/10. The sun was intense and I burned pretty bad during the race. The energy was electric but I was feeling pretty calm and eager to get underway. I remember reading two comments on Reddit a few days earlier ""Please please please save something for the Newton Hills"" and ""Aim for high cadence after Heartbreak so you don't wreck your quads going towards Cleveland Circle"". I did my best to keep this in mind, but still went out a bit too fast at around a 6:35-6:40 pace. The first 6-8 miles dragged by, I actually didn't find them particularly easy; I don't know if I wasn't feeling it or not but I was feeling a bit sluggish and labored from the start.

I kept pace and was enjoying the crowd energy as we came up to the half - 1:28 on my watch. A bit fast, but not too bad. I was a little nervous for what was to come and slowed up just a little. The next 3-4 miles starting feeling pretty rough...I think the heat was getting to me. I saw my family at 16, right after the big downhill going into Newton, right as my left quad was starting to really hurt. We began the hills, and it was actually a bit of a relief, as using some new muscles felt great after so much downhill to that point. I was tired, but knew I just had to get through Newton. I've run the hills maybe 2-3 times in training and was actually most worried about the 1st and 3rd hill. I wasn't wrong; these were very tough and I was starting to hurt pretty bad.

After Heartbreak, the wheels came off. I've never cramped up before, so this was a new experience for me. I started to feel a slight shock/twinge in my calf and then it would completely lock up for a split second. I was just hoping every single step that I could straddle the line without it locking up completely. My fueling was great, and I started taking in more gatorade, hoping the extra carbs and electrolytes might help. Every step was a cramp and agony in my left quad as I pushed to the finish.

The rest of the race is pretty much a blur. I recall seeing the Citgo sign, thinking it was so, so far away, wondering if I should stop and stretch, questioning how much I really cared about going sub-3 anyway. At one point I looked at my watch and it was predicting a 3:01 and I almost stopped then and there. I pushed forward and didn't even notice the little dip under the overpass, trying to pick up the pace. Right on Hereford, left on Boylston. My watch told me I was now going to be around 2:59:30. Everyone says running on Boylston is a transcendent experience and frankly, it was terrible. All I could do was push forward as hard as I could. Stretch for the finish...2:59:25 on my watch. BQ.

I am extremely satisfied for going sub-3, something I thought would never even be possible a few years ago as someone living with MS and training through a mobility disability. I'm really proud of the accomplishment and the journey to get here. Some things went really well, my nutrition was on point (275g carbs total taken in during the race), which is why I think I didn't bonk completely. My pacing and strategy could have been better but my splits weren't too bad all things considered. Did I enjoy the experience? I think so, but I'm still processing it all. I'll certainly come back to Boston, maybe next year, but I'm not sure yet. I think if I do I won't grind for a big PR and instead try and soak up this iconic race more than I could on Monday. I'm not entirely sure what is next. I'm signed up for the NYC Marathon, but I may defer until next year, and I have some shorter distance things over the summer.

GOALS: 
- run without stopping 
- my dream time was 3:25, but i mainly wanted to get under 3:30. i felt it was reasonable, but with the elevation profile i wasn’t sure.

TRAINING 
i followed the pfitz 18/55 plan religiously. there was one weekend when i got sick and had to skip a sunday “long run”, but it was an easy week so that was only 12 miles and i made up most of it the next day instead of taking a rest day.

training was brutal, as i’m a morning runner and i leave for work at 7-7:30. at the worst, i woke up at 3:45 to do a 14 mile run at 4:45. the tuneup races were by far the hardest (6:50-7:00 pace for 5-7 miles), much more than the long marathon pace runs (peaked at 7:50 pace for 18 miles). i did my long runs mostly around 9:00 pace, with one 20 miler pushed to 21 miles at an 8:40 pace with negative splits.

most of the training was psychological - i wanted to feel confident that i could finish strong, and pfitz fully did that. i almost felt like the marathon would be “easy” compared to my training.

other important thing about my training - i always run fasted, and usually don’t fuel during long runs. i practiced fueling with 1-2 applesauces or mini fruit bars in the first half of training, but in the second half i stopped fueling and did many long runs without eating anything (including the 18 mile MP and last 20 miler).

PRE RACE 
in the last week, i modified my diet to increase carbs and decrease fats and fiber. this was tough because normally i eat a TON of fiber; but i didn’t want to risk making a long pit stop during the marathon.

my sleep was really bad in the ~10 days leading up to the race. i would lie awake for 1-2 hours and then only get 5-6 hours of sleep before waking up to run/work. i was stressed because i’m a teacher and it was also the last week of school (impeccable timing, i know).

i drank a nuun tablet every day and took a lot of immunity boosters (vitamin c etc) as i felt some hints of sickness coming on.

yesterday (day before my race), i ate very carb heavy with a bit of protein added in. 1 moderate breakfast at 8:45 and 1 moderate dinner at 4. done eating by 5pm ish. in bed around 7:30!

RACE DAY 
woke up naturally at 3 and laid in bed before getting up at 3:15. my alarm was 3:50, but i had crazy nerves. i drank half a cup of hot water and then slowly sipped a cold brew coffee. i normally don’t drink caffeine anymore, so those first 4oz were hitting.

got dressed, covered all my skin in body glide, attached my bib! i woke up my boyfriend and we headed out at 5. there was a lot of traffic, so he pulled over and i walked about 0.6 miles to the start line (good warmup!). he got lucky and found parking, so he met me to take my bag and i didn’t need to use gear check. as i was loading up my run belt, i realized i forgot my water bottle! no sweat, i asked my bf to hand it off to me when i ran past our apartment at mile 6 (so cool that we were along the route!!).

- mile 1-6: flew by! i wanted to start a bit slower, but i rode the energy of the crowd. i wasn’t wearing my airpods, so i smiled and thanked the people who came to cheer for us. also saw my bf and our dog and got my water bottle :D 
- mile 7-12: several light hills, but i was staying strong. i felt like my splits were too fast, but i didn’t really feel like i was fatiguing. also i felt pressured by the runners around me haha. my corral was 3:20-3:40 so there was a pretty wide range in terms of pace.
- mile 13-20: steep downhill at mi 13, which was rough on the bones. around mi 15, the 7:35 pace finally caught up to me and i tried to slow down. i was also getting bored, so i threw on my airpods and listened to my premade playlist of taylor swift songs, lol (ttpd got me through soo many training runs). 
- mile 20-23: i wanted to conserve energy for the big hill at mile 22.5 (230 ft over 1 mile), so i slowed down the pace a bit more. the hill was KILLER, and i started to get ghost cramps in my calves that scared me. i saw so many people walking or stretching, and i didn’t want to stop. i ran slow but i made it without stopping. 
- mile 24-end: miles 24 and 25 felt insanely long. i never looked at my watch because at that point i didn’t even care about my time. i was close enough to my goal and so focused on not cramping or stopping. i veered to the side to high five someone in the crowd and my calf cramped pretty badly, which scared me into laser sharp focus. once i hit 26, i realized i was going to make it and finally picked up the pace. finished strong!!

fuel: 2 applesauce (had 1 at mi 12, 1 at mi 19), 1 fruit bar (didn’t eat), electrolyte salt chews (had 10 over the course of the race, mostly toward the end as i worried about cramping lol)"

**The Day Before**

We drive to Lawrence because we don’t have much to do and I want my two-year-old to check Kansas off her list of states. Missouri is number 13 and Kansas makes more than a baker’s dozen. 

I got my bib and t-shirt the day before at Union Station in Kansas City and I even got to chat with the local elderly woman at the information booth. Turns out that Kansas City is the best city in the world with the best restaurants and the best public transit and the best people and gee whiz this is an unbiased take if I’ve ever seen one. I tell her I’m from New York which gets a reaction.

 “Well I tell you! You came all the way from New York, I always tell people that our marathon is just as good as Boston and New York.”

I pause to wait for the punchline but nothing comes and I cringe hopefully not outwardly. 

Anyway, we make it to Lawrence and I’ll just say that KU is a bit underwhelming? Perhaps I expect too much from a university that has no lack of land and apparently some amount of cachet, especially if you pay attention to basketball. The big baby sleeps the whole way and barely even registers a picture with the Jayhawk. 

Alas, her trip to Kansas was really for me anyway. 

**The Startline**

I amazingly get through my butterflies and keep down a banana and a kinder bar, along with some Gatorade and a few coffees. It’s an easy walk around the corner but hoo boy are there a lot of people at the start. 5k, 10k, half, full, oh Lordy. 

I’ve got old throwaway clothes on so I avoid the gear check and just do a warm-up jog. Then head to the start corral half hour early cause there’s nothing better to do. I accidentally meet the mayor which given I’ve been watching The Wire, I’m acutely aware of how big a deal the Mayor of any town is, so I’m humbled. Sadly wouldn’t be the end of humbling me for the day.

Chatting with the first two guys who come into the start chute. We’re just hanging out around some cyclists hoping to hop on back at some point. Then the handcycles come, some handicap charity folks, and the corral finally starts filling up with say twenty minutes to go.

“Oh I’m gonna run really conservatively, 2:43 or so. Anything better would be awesome”

Holy Moses I’m in the wrong spot. What the hell is this guy talking about? And then my other new best friend says he’s shooting for 2:45! I check their bibs and they’re definitely doing the full, so I start grimacing at this awful location I’ve been thrust into. The pacers just behind us are way way slower and I’m just thinking yikes this is no bueno.

With ten minutes before start time, I make a sacrifice to the God of Gu and cross myself. Then I make a joke about running in my huge jacket and sweatpants and it’s unclear if the joke lands. I plan on throwing them away just before the start because they’re better at a thrift store than they are for another ten years in my attic. My two little speed demon friends and I gracefully part ways when I freak out about my eyeglasses that I left in this dumb jacket.

Just kidding, off to gear check I go! I beg for an extra bag and apologize for my idiocy, which the gear check folks take very kindly given the race starts in four minutes. Not the adrenaline I was really hoping for but hey.

**The First Half**

I had driven it the day before so I knew mostly what I was in for: hills hills and more hills. Kansas City forgot to learn about flatness from Kansas. Patrick Mahomes needs to get on the town council about the road surfaces and the topography the real athletes had to deal with today. Oof, I know the start and finish were the same line but it feels like we went up triple what we went down.

From mile 0 to mile 5 I got passed by approximately every entrant in the race. I never got passed by my “target pace” pacer group so I didn’t feel like a gigantic turd for my start corral placement, just like medium-sized.

At mile 9 there’s a turnaround and we see some folks just a little ahead of us. Some woman is running barefoot? And awkwardly enough also beating me. I’m in my cheater pink shoes but she’s au naturel.

**The Second Half**

A guy pulls up behind me. He’s very friendly and in a bit too good of a mood for mile 15 especially when we’ve been going uphill for two miles. I complain about the uphill because I mostly wanna make sure it’s not just flat that I’m psychologically increasing to up. He acknowledges that it is indeed uphill which is a relief, but then he kills me by saying it’s uphill til the turnaround at mile 19. 

He says we’re about to pass his house and I say I’m from New York. He said he was just there two weeks ago and I’m like “Holy hell me too!” We’re basically wins but he’s faster and saunters away like a very big and well-groomed squirrel. Before he puts me in my place with his feet, he tells me he signed up yesterday and is just doing this as a training run for the week. Ouch. Right where it hurts, the pride.

**Mile 20**

I hit the turnaround and if it was all uphill to get here then it must be all down to get home, right? Ha! Wrong! It’s net downhill but it’s a disturbing amount of rolling. At mile 21 I happen upon a familiar-looking white hat. Oh boy, it’s my conservative 2:43 champion walking along. I’m kinda sad for him but also kinda like hmmmm pride goeth before the fall my man. Not sure how ‘conservative’ that target time really was now.

But then again I’m also falling apart and I’d like to think I was running conservatively. I’m just falling apart less than most folks around me. 

At mile 23, I’m chasing down a familiar blue singlet and I’m just like ouch this was a bad group of chatting at the start corral, three overconfident crooks just getting served by the hills of suburban Missouri. I pass him and he says his legs gave up on him. I know exactly how he feels, my legs have given up on me many many times. 

Pretty much every time.

**The Finish**

I’m feeling pretty good (well, just a stone’s throw from hellish which is excellent all things considered) and I’m debating whether I pick up my two year old at the finish line. How much time will I have to spare? Her grandma, my mom, said they’d be somewhere between 25.5 and 26.2 which is a pretty big amount of roadway to try to find a non-descriptive elderly white woman.

I decide to do it as long as they’re after the 26 mile mark. I’m a little concerned my daughter will put up a fight, which I can take for a few hundred yards but probably not for half a mile. 

They’re at 26.1 and I yell to them. I sneak across to the half-marathon chute and I yell at her “Hey! Ya whackadoodle!!” I grab her from across the barrier and we finish together. Pretty sure I’m in the same minute I would’ve been otherwise. 

She enjoys when I put the finisher’s medal around her neck. We get a photo at the finish line and it’s definitely one I’ll pay for.

She’s beaming the rest of the morning even though she has no idea what is happening. I’m way happier than she is.

49th sub-3 state. 2:56. Hawaii is all that’s left."

### Background on me
I am a mid-30's male, was a mediocre XC and track runner in HS and college (one of the slower guys on a d3 team). PRs of 2:03 800, 16:low 5k, 27:high 8k. Ran a few >10 mile runs at sub-6 pace, though never raced a half. Tried 2 marathons shortly after college w/o training seriously and dropped out both times - figured I had plenty of time later in life to put in a serious training block.

I spent the next ~10 years after college gradually running less and less until 2022 when I got covid and we had our first kid, then over the next year and a half I barely ran at all (~40 miles/month).  At the beginning of 2024 I was very unhappy with my fitness, so I joined a local running club. I wish I had done that 8 years sooner, but better late than never. I put in a good 2024 (~1800 miles) and by the end of the year I felt like I was starting to get back in decent shape - not near my college fitness, but good ""training"" shape at least. I ran a 17:50 turkey trot 5k and a 4:49 1500 time trial by myself.

For the previous couple years I had been thinking all my best running days are behind me and there's nowhere to go but down, but the past year has been very encouraging.  I don't expect to ever get back to my college-level fitness or shorter-distance times, but at this point I feel like I can get close (within 10-20s a mile).

After seeing much of my running club run CIM in December, I started wondering if I could get in shape to run another marathon.  I didn't want to just jog one to say I did it, so I decided if I thought I could get sub-3, I'd be willing to give it a try. I did a 13-mile training run mid-December to test my longer-distance fitness, averaging 6:43 pace, which honestly felt really good. Afterwards I thought I could have kept up that pace for another 5-7 miles, so I decided a March marathon was a good goal.

### Training 

Overall, I was very happy with how this training block went. I started from a base of ~45-50mph with LRs in the 12-16 mile range, did a 10-week buildup, then 2-week taper. I averaged about 60mpw, including two 35-40 mile weeks when I got sick. Peaked at 75, and had a couple others at 70+. Mostly in singles, except an occasional double in the highest mileage weeks. I did not follow a specific marathon training plan, but a typical week looked like this:

* M: track workout, VO2max or threshold
* T: ~50-70 min easy (usu. 8+ min pace)
* W: ""short"" long run (up to 15 miles)
* Th: easier tempo/threshold workout on roads
* F: ~50-70 min easy (usu. 8+ min pace)
* S: long run (7 of 17+, 4 of 20+, peaking at 23.5)
* Su: off or <4 miles very easy

About half of the midweek long runs were slow (>8 min pace) and about half were SS or had some MP/quality thrown in.  All of the weekend long runs were SS (~6:50-7:30 pace), had significant MP chunks, or both.  I somewhat arbitrarily chose 6:40 as my ""MP"" for training, and figured I'd adjust up/down as needed.

Some notable workouts:
* 8 weeks out: 20 miles at ~7:05 pace. Still felt decent by the end.
* 6 weeks out: 3200m race in 10:58 (first track race in 10 years!) followed by a 14 mile long run the next day with the last 9 miles at 6:35 pace. This felt great - I thought I could have kept going at that pace for days.
* 5 weeks out: 13.1 race w/ first 11 at ~goal MP (6:34) and pushing it the last 2 miles (6:15). Did a long cooldown with 2 more miles at MP after the race. This was harder than I wanted it to be (the 2 MP miles in the c/d were very hard), though I was a bit sick, it was at the end of my highest-mileage week, and the race was on gravel, so I thought those were reasonable excuses.
* 4 weeks out: 17 miles with 2x5 miles at ""MP"", which I ran too fast (6:25 for first 5, 6:15 for second 5), but again it felt really good. I was tired afterwards but definitely had more in the tank.
* 3 weeks out: 23.5 miles at 6:59 pace. 8:20 first mile to warm up, then progressing from 7:30s down to 6:30s. This felt really good through 22 miles, then I ran a 6:15 23rd mile to see what was left in the tank, after which I was pretty tired.

By the end of this I felt like I was in very good shape. The only things that didn't go as well were strength training (half-assed it once a week, need to do a lot more next time), and I haven't slept well in many weeks because our 2-year old is going through a bit of a sleep regression. I never felt like I was over-trained. I would have an occasional bad workout or run, but never felt bad or tired for more than a couple days in a row.  After about a week of taper (down to 40 miles, still w/ some workouts but a bit less volume) I just felt really good all around. I felt less good the final week (30 miles in 6 days, a couple easy/short workouts), especially my legs, but thought that was pretty standard for a taper.

### Pre-race/Plan
I was very happy with how training had gone. I felt like I was at a similar level of fitness to some folks that had run ~2:50-2:51 at CIM in December, and thought on a great day I could be sniffing 2:50. But, since I was inexperienced and have never really done marathon-specific training, I figured I'd be more cautious and aim to start out at 6:35 for the first several miles, and adjust up or down if needed. I wanted to get a BQ, but not knowing what the cutoff will be I figured sub-2:54 (BQ-6) was a good proxy.

I was very anxious/nervous for a few weeks before this race and definitely thought about it way too much. I did standard carbo-loading the 2 days before (did not count calories, but I ate a lot). I did not sleep well the night before - some combo of nerves, hard hotel bed, and weird Modesto night noises.


### Race
Weather was decent - 50 degrees at the start and got up to about 60 and sunny by the end, which was warm, but not awful.  I had Gus + a salt stick chew every 3.5 miles and sipped a handheld water every few minutes (~16oz every 7 miles). I had practiced this in training and was confident my stomach could handle it (was never able to get any kind of non-water drink to feel good). I wore Saucony Endorphin Pro 4's with about 150 miles on them.  The course is flat and fast.

First mile felt super easy, as always. I had to consciously slow myself down several times and still ended up faster than intended. My HR was a bit higher than I would have expected (168, expected around 160 based on training) but I chalked that up to race-day adrenaline.

The next several miles were not very notable. HR still seemed high at near 170, so I just tried to focus on staying relaxed and settling in. Aerobically I felt great, though my legs felt just okay. My stomach was getting sloshy by mile 5 or so, but I was still able to eat/drink okay.

Miles 6-10 felt pretty good. Still in the 6:35-6:40 range. Aerobically still felt like a piece of cake, legs were not getting any worse. Hit the 10-mile at 1:06:00 or right at 6:36 pace. 

Miles 11-12 my legs started feeling worse. This was not uncommon in my training runs - I often had lots of highs and lows during a run, so I figured this was just one of the lows, and thought I'd be able to recover if I backed off the effort a little bit.

I did start feeling better miles 13-14, and at that point was still pretty confident I could finish near or maybe even better than my 2:53 goal.

Then we turned around after mile 14, and I very quickly started running out of gas. I checked my HR and it was 175 (I know not to overindex on HR, but this was in the definitely-too-high-for-halfway-through-a-race range). My legs were starting to feel very heavy and tired and slow. This was a different tired than I had experienced in any of the training runs (except maybe the very end of the 23-miler after tempoing a 6:15 last mile). I intentionally slowed down again and stopped looking at the pace on my watch since I knew I was over 6:40s at this point. I gutted out a few miles like this but it was starting to become clear I was not going to magically recover and start feeling better.

By about mile 17 I was continuing to feel worse despite still slowing down, and I was pretty confident I was not going to make it. I gutted out another 3 miles and met my partner at mile 20, then called it a day. Had no interest in slogging out 6 more miles at 8 minute pace to ""just finish.""

### Post-race
I stretched/sulked for about 10 minutes, then headed back to the start to watch other runners finish. Honestly I didn't feel that bad the rest of the day or the day after - my calves are a bit tired and my legs in general feel sore, but it's not awful. Probably a good thing I didn't run another 6 miles though.

I don't regret dropping out, I'm just disappointed in the race overall. If I'd made it 22 miles then started blowing up, that would be one thing. I could blame that on a minor thing or two I could tweak for next time.  But this didn't feel like I was particularly ""close"" - I felt awful with still 10 miles to go. My biggest issue in the past has been getting sick constantly (toddler bringing something home from daycare every 2 weeks) and I thought if I could show up healthy on race day I should easily be able to get well under 3:00, but clearly I was mistaken.

I am not sure exactly what went wrong. My best guess is it's a combination of several things - being a bit overconfident in my current fitness and probably going out too fast, nerves/inexperience/not having done a ton of marathon-specific training before, and maybe just having a bad day overall.

### What's Next?
I would love to try again, but we are having our second kid in ~July of this year, and I know there is 0 chance I will be able to put in any decent training for many months after that point.  So, that leaves me with about 3 months left.

First, I am going to take a week off to recharge mentally and physically (haven't taken a week off in over a year - maybe that was part of my problem too). After that, I'd like to do a hard 5k and maybe race a half in 4-5 weeks to try to get some better fitness benchmarks and maybe inform what MP should actually be close to.  I'll see how I'm doing at that point.  There are a handful of west-coast marathons in June, so I may have another reasonable shot at a BQ there. The timing won't be perfect training-wise, but I think it's doable. If I do run a marathon again soon, I think I will try to start out slower at least.  Maybe aim for 6:40-6:45 for a while, and if I'm feeling good, pick it up in the later stages. But we'll see how things go.

Anywho, if you made it to the end (or just scrolled here), thanks for reading, and good luck in your upcoming races!

“Think of me as your co-pacer.”

Huh, weird self-appointment, but there was supposed to be another pacer anyway, so I’m not bothered.

It’s my first time pacing and this was my first rookie mistake.

Hard things are hard because the challenge comes as a surprise. The distance of the race isn’t what’s hard, it’s the things you never saw coming: getting a shoulder (what? I forgot I had shoulders) cramp, feeling too good too early and letting unthinking ambition carry you forward, forgetting to drink in the cold, not realizing how much you haven’t recovered from last week’s workout, confusing tapering and injury, some self-indulgent twat who anoints himself a race official.

Anyway, the guy meant to be my co-pacer (not this ninny I’m talking to right now) was someone I’d run with a few times before. He was wicked experienced, and we had gotten along just fine. I figured I’d take a backseat to someone with more than zero experience, so why not tolerate a new pace man instead? How bad could a last-minute self-righteously self-appointed co-pacer be?

Pretty bad.

**The Run-up**

I had slept intermittently as always. I’ve only missed one race start due to oversleeping. Couldn’t even hear the rocks pelting my dorm room window. I had actually set the alarm but the damn clock radio toggles were faulty, so I tossed it. We’re now in the era of pocket supercomputers so my alarms are reliable. Doesn’t preclude me from pointless hourly time checks ensuring I don’t dream about the finish line.

I board the bus at godless o’clock which is ok:thirty on the East Coast, but I’m still angsty. I try to figure where to stash my pretentious pacer pole. A mid-20s woman asks to sit next to me, which is the first time I’ve ever been approached by a woman not holding pepper spray. I attempt a smile and a ‘sure’ but my awkwardness gets an early start to her tab of regrets for this race.

She courageously remains sitting next to a bedraggled bearded buffoon and makes small talk in an attempt to make the 26 mile bus ride feel shorter than the 26 mile return jog. She’s much more impressive than I am, a med student being a fancier occupation than unemployed comedian. But she sees my pacer sign and feels one down. 

“Oh wow, are you like part of the race? Are you leading a group targeting that time? How’d you get into it?”

“Ha - the organizers sent out an email to everyone and I just opted in. Never paced before but I was already signed up for today. Race entry refund in exchange for carrying a sign and slowing down a bit seemed like a good deal. Plus a fun new experience.”

“Oh geez so you’re even faster than your sign? Sorry if that’s a weird question. Today’s my first ever marathon”

“No worries, yea, the pace should be steady and comfortable. Not easy, but running is never easy.”

I don’t notice (I’m married), but she looks pretty fit. I would’ve thought she might be in my group, guess not. I only make her cringe twice more the rest of the way, which is a new personal best and the race hasn’t even started.

**The Start**

Pottapotties flank upright heaters in some sort of fecal funeral procession towards the deserted start line. I’m uncomfortably close to the front as it’s clear everybody in the race is convinced they’re the slowest person here.

It’s cold, drizzling, and I’m in heaven. I won’t see the sun for hours. I shiver at the race start, and I know today will feel easy because of the weather. Easy is a tough word, but I’m not brave enough to think about the finale where even easy is a struggle. I’ve done this dozens of times, but I still keep to my standard race routine and hurl in the portapotty before lining up. I can’t help it, the paranoia is real, and if you aren’t nervous, you don’t care. More likely that I’m just a coward, and my anxiety pills have worn off early before the running endorphins put me at peace at mile 5.

I’m holding my sign and chatting to people aiming for the time. Yep, the beginning is downhill, the pace plan is to go out fast and then slow down significantly for the uphills and then be a bit over average for the final few miles.

“Damn, they just postponed the race again!” Another 15 minutes due to bus logistics and late arrivers. I put my hoody back on and we debate who’s most likely to miss their flight. 

“Mine’s tomorrow, I’m good”

“Mine’s at 2, so I’m pretty worried”

I chime in: “Mine’s at fucking noon dude I’m petrified. It was already close with the early start.”

“Oh god, you’re toast.”

They undelay the final 15 minutes and the gun goes off.

**The First Half**

A few miles in and there still isn’t really a pace group yet, we’re just mixed in the mass of joggers that extends all the way back to the walkers. The runners up ahead of us might be in ones and twos or little distinct groups, but they’re out of sight. They’re trying to *win* and are really in a different race.

The only person who talked for the first 15 miles was the co-pacer, a man whose voice must’ve powered his legs or something. He kept giving questionable advice and seemed balls deep into running pseudoscience.

In between weird stride commentary, we get the first true gem: “you guys really need to thank pacer TheRollingJones because pacers are super underappreciated and we should do a round of applause and make sure to write your race director applauding the pacers.” I almost turned around and ran the other direction. What do you even say?

“I pace a lot of races and we used to get free flights and hotels but now people just don’t care and it’s a dying art. All of you will finish in great times and the pacer will just be a moving finish line ending his race alone in sadness.”

There’s more, but I can’t bear myself to relive those hours at the mercy of this random usurper whose favorite race is my least favorite (NYC). He loves the party, I hate the logistics. Fine to have a difference of opinion, but I’m just trying to crystallize my feelings: we were not soulmates, even if we’re both gigantic turds.

I’m adding distance to the course by shimmying away from my co-pacer. I’m like a sheepdog orbiting making everyone concerned about my neuroticism.

**The Second Half or: Did you know the final 10k is half a marathon?**

I’d been praying for him to disappear and I retreat inwards. Weirdly at mile 20 it feels calm, I look around, and he’s a ghost. So I start chatting to the group which by now is clearly a group rather than an amorphous line of people beating us and people trailing and failing. It’s raining harder, and I’m giving splits (slightly fast) and bits of encouragement (rah rah). No coaching other than that it should hurt real bad by now, but that it’ll also end sooner than they fear. Everything ends.

It should be the worst pain you’ve ever felt, unless you’ve had a baby. 

“If you feel anything better than dead, you should really speed up right now. Time’s running out to lower your time.”

A teenager in all black glances at me for confirmation. Begins a ritual that can only mean he’s been holding back immensely. Offers a hand, smiles, asks to be excused from the group apologetically as if I’m some kind of prison warden. 

“Fly, boy, fly!” He tweaks from a jog to a run, his engine igniting from a yellow purr to a blue roar. He looks awesome and I feel like a mama bird.

In the final 10k, he knocks off several minutes. Glory glory, I’m proud but I won’t know how proud for what’s technically measured in minutes but feels like years.

The weirdest thing about pacing was that I felt terrible at mile 15 and worried I’d let everyone down. Do I get un-refunded if I flop? I dunno but the usual pain just never came and I kept cruising. Usually the miles in the 20s are erosive and destructive. They wear you down and make your watch start telling you half-truths. Heart rate’s too high, pace too low, total time becoming more and more total. I continue on pace (fine, slightly fast) and it’s more hard training run than it is race.

The co-pacer was right about one thing: finishing was weird. We’d lost a bunch of people earlier who hit 20 and fell apart. Nothing I could do: I’m tied to the time, not to any racer. Then everyone who held on by mile 24 actually sped up, except this one ugly bearded guy in a hat making poverty wages to run a steady pace and stave off boredom by mentally composing an unhinged race report. I went from a group of 30 down to a solo effort almost instantly. 

The saving grace was this blue tanktop guy who was struggling bad. He was twenty feet behind and I knew he’d make the time but it would be close and not pretty.  That’s ok though, I specialize in not pretty (don’t tell my wife!). The final mile lasted an eternity, but surely longer for him. I yell at him that it’ll be over soon, just a few minutes remaining, we hit 26. We turn right and can see the finish - we finish together, very much a whimper. I sandbag the final 0.2 by just a hair to get closer to the target.

**Finished**

33 seconds ahead of the target time. That’s under a second per kilometer albeit over per mile. I’m pretty content with that type of accuracy. If you want a moving finish line, you’re gonna have to look elsewhere - I was upfront with everybody that the goal time was just under the ‘official’ pace. There’s something strange about whole number finishing times, especially for a race where distance is so fucking arbitrary. What even is 385 yards?

But my co-pacer? 26 minutes down. What a goon. Guess he stopped talking and his legs gave up. A minute per mile off pace? A minute per mile.

At the finish, I see most of my crew. They’re congratulating each other and I finally put down the damn pacing sign. The teenager gives me a hug, he killed it but next time will be even better. I give everyone high fives and then bolt back to my hotel. My fastest two miles of the day, no pace bracelet slowing me down from getting changed and an Uber to the airport.

I make my flight even after getting dropped off at the wrong terminal. Extra cooldown walking I guess.

The results?

2:59:27 and almost everyone I paced broke 3. Lovely."

Course.  It's pretty flat, but I wouldn't call it pancake.  About 500 to 600 ft of elevation gain mostly in gradual inclines.  About 30% of the course is on fine gravel it's all in the 2nd half made it almost impossible for me to negative split.   It also rain a ton the day before so the gravel was soft and slippery in spots.  

Conditions: temperature was perfect about 44 overcast, but the windy was brutal about 15 miles per hour and you pretty much felt let you were running straight into it the entire second half. 

Race: well put on race, logistically it's so easy just walk up to the start line.  There was about 7 or so people under 2:50 and quite a few under 3, so plenty of race people to run with.  

My race:  first 10k was into the wind felt decent had to push a little hard than I would've liked. The goal was average 620 on the front and then negative split.   But with the wind being so bad I had to push it the next 12k with the tailwind.    I pretty much set around 4th to 5th the whole race.  Had a solid group of 3 to 4 of us rolling through the halfway point.   Fuel was on point about 80 or so carbs an hour.  Had a 12 ounce bottle with 1000 MG of sodium little too concentrated.   I need to figure how to do that better. Came through 1:22:40ish right on pace. 

Start of the 2nd loop you have about a mile or so then you hit the gravel.  Goal time went out the window and it was just racing for place and going off vibes.   Miles 15 to 19 wasn't  horrible, but the gravel really started affecting my legs. Then we hit this last gravel section for about 4 miles.  It was pretty muddy and I was 100% falling apart.   

Around mile 23 we got back on pavement.  I did my best to keep 630s into the wind, but mile 25 was straight into the hardest headwind on the course.   

Got past by a couple guys, but was able to pull in and pass 2 others.  Sprinted the finish and was glad to be done.  

Results.   4th place over all. PR 2:48:30 official time. 

Summary: Good race experience, but I wouldn't do it again.  I run 2 marathons a year and I focus on running as fast as possible.   The gravel if not wet would have only slowed me down probably 4 or so seconds, but to me that's enough to avoid.  The change in surface I found really tough.  But it was really pretty and put on well.  There's some 180 degree turn arounds so you get to see people even if you're in a spot by yourself which is helpful.   Not alot of people cheering.    It's a good one to do if it's not an A race, which for me it wasn't.   Goal was try to run sub 2:47 gain race experience and build the foundation to run sub 243 at CIM in December.   So I got what I needed out of this race. "

# My 5 Step Marathon Plan

**Step 1: Tear Your Meniscus**

Okay, I understand if you don’t want to follow my simple plan step-by-step, but this is how it started for me.

I won’t bore you with all the details (I wrote about it previously [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1c6hxg0/race_report_boston_marathon_on_a_torn_meniscus/)), but the short story is: around this time last year, I found myself with a painful knee injury.  I took some time off of running, hoping to recover before Boston training got underway, but the pain didn’t go away.  Finally, with Boston creeping closer and closer, I got an MRI and a diagnosis: a torn meniscus.

“Will this get better if I stop running?”, I asked the orthopedist.  He shook his head: “Nope”. “Will it get worse if I keep running?”, I asked the orthopedist.  He shook his head: “Nope”.

That was all I needed to hear.  Though it was painful, I resumed training for Boston and ended up running 3:03 on a short and broken training cycle.  I was thrilled even to have made it to the starting line.  But more importantly, the better shape I got into throughout the cycle, the less knee pain I had.  In the months following the marathon, I kept training and was able to rehab the knee back to more or less a non-issue.

**Step 2: Run a Bunch of Miles; Run Some Fast**

Towards the end of the summer, with the knee injury at bay, I started feeling ready for revenge.  For the past couple of years, a question has been looming over my training...  I’m now 46 years old and have been running marathons for 10+ years at this point.  My previous PR of 2:46 was a dream come true - I never thought I’d run a race like that.  Could I still possibly run any faster, or were my PR days behind me?  I was determined to find out.

I typically don't follow a precise training plan, but I always have training principles I try to follow for any cycle.  My guiding principles for this cycle were simple:

* run a lot of miles (duh)
* run whatever pace you feel like most of the time
* run more miles at 5:xx pace

Running a lot of miles meant \~70 MPW average, peaking at 87, and dipping to \~45 a couple of weeks as life or minor illness got in the way.  Running more miles at 5:xx pace meant more aggressive fast finishes, especially on long runs (my bread & butter), and a couple of speed sessions, though honestly not many.  I basically didn’t care when and where, just more miles below 6.

My body responded well to the training - I couldn’t believe I was putting in 80+ MPW weeks and didn’t feel overly tired or sore.  I did a final 20 miler 2-weeks out and got to the taper with just some mild niggles, which fortunately largely cleared up with a couple of days of lower volume.

I also got hit with a cold just as the taper started - but that’s okay, it was all part of the plan!  I get sick almost every fall when the taper starts, so now I just count on it as part of the schedule.

**Step 3: Find a Fast Pack, and Hang On**

Race day!

My nutrition strategy before previous marathons: let’s nibble on a bagel and take dainty sips of Gatorade so we don’t upset our little tummy-wummies.  My nutrition strategy for this race: do you think I can eat 2500 calories before 6AM?

Ok, not really 2500, but I ate way more than I have in the past: bagels, a huge bowl of yogurt, banana, 3 gels, 2 bottles of Gatorade.  My thinking here is that I have a pretty iron stomach, and have never had stomach issues during a marathon; I have however, bonked at least a couple of times.  So let’s err on the side of over-fueling.

I got to the race with just enough time to wait in line to pee, immediately get back in the same line to pee again, and then head to the start.

The first three miles of the race are shared with the half marathon, so the course is (relatively speaking) pretty packed.  I was aiming for 6:15 (2:45-ish), but ended up ticking off the first couple of miles in 6:10-ish pace.  Interestingly, I also felt an unexpected mental struggle early on: what am I even doing here?  Do I really think I can hold this pace for 26 miles?  But pretty quickly I put it aside: I run.  This is what I do.

Just before mile 3, the half marathon broke off and the field thinned out to… basically nothing.  Everybody was pretty scattered at this point, and though there were some others nearby, I wasn’t really running with anybody.  This continued for a couple of miles when I caught up to another guy and we started running together for a bit, and then eventually caught up with another 3 runners, 2 men, and the lead woman.

**Step 4: Don’t Pass Out**

I ran with this pack (and a police escort, courtesy of the lead woman) and watched the splits as the miles went by, all under 6:10.  Is going this pace really a good idea?  I felt okay, but I was clearly the weakest of the group, falling back at times and then having to pick up the pace to keep up.

I looked back into the void of scattered runners behind us.  There were no other groups to run with.  Should I fall back and run a lonely race at a more reasonable pace?  Or do I stay with this speedy crew and try to hang on?  Even if the pace was hotter than I wanted, I knew it would be far easier to run with a group than to go it alone.  I made the decision to stick with the group as long as I could and hope for the best.

We passed through the half at 1:20:01.  Yikes - I have no business going that fast in the first half of a marathon.  I felt okay, but knew I couldn’t hold this pace through the second half.  Fortunately for me, a mile or two into the second half, the pack started to break up, with 2 of the guys making a move faster, and the lead woman and one of the other guys hanging back just slightly.  The splits through mile 20 were closer to 6:15, which at this point was still tough for me, but no longer suicidal.

By mile 22 or so, I had started to feel pretty rough, but I looked at my watch and realized I had banked a ton of time for a PR.  The only thing that could possibly get in the way of a big PR now would be ending up in a medical tent.  So I made a plan for the closing miles: DO NOT PASS OUT.  The two I was still running with, started to break away as I slowed down, but my splits for miles 23-25 were \~6:28.  Not even terrible.  My hands were tingling slightly, but dear reader, I did not pass out.

**Step 5: Don’t Pass Out, but Also: Catch That Guy!**

As I hung on for dear life somewhere in mile 24 I looked up ahead and spotted a guy I recognized from Strava, who I knew to be a *Fast Dude*.  And by the transitive property of running, I knew that if I could beat him, I would logically also be a *Fast Dude*.  Suddenly, not passing out took a slight backseat to catching the *Fast Dude*.

Right around the mile 25 mark, I passed him.  I gave it all I had to put some space in between us, and at first it was working.   But then with about half a mile to go, he put it in another gear and passed me back, and immediately pulled far ahead.  There was no chance of catching him, but on the plus side, I’d ticked off mile 26 in 6:10 thanks to our little back-and-forth.

And then, after the longest .2 miles I’ve ever run, I crossed the line in 2:43:18 for over a 3-minute PR.  The *Fast Dude* finished 10 seconds ahead of me.

**What’s Next**

This race finally answered my burning question: at 46, I was still capable of running a PR.  And what’s more, now I feel like I can do even better.  Holding 1:20 for the first half and not blowing up in the second was a huge confidence boost.  And while this was a great training cycle, I think there's plenty of room to build on it.  How can I look at this race and not be thinking about 2:40?  While I don't know if I'm actually capable of it, this race gives me the confidence to try."

# Training

This was my fifth marathon (previous times: 4:15:56, 3:58:55, 4:00:19, 3:35:00). Training went really well. I mostly followed the Pfitzinger 18/70 plan after some base building at the end of last year. The plan officially started on December 23 (and I even managed to fit in the runs during the holidays).  
At the end of January, I was on vacation for a week, during which I only did some light treadmill runs in the evenings (after skiing during the day), so I kind of missed one week.

Overall, training consisted of 108 runs, totaling 1,743 km. Nine of those were longer than 30k (longest was 36k), and another 26 were at least half marathon distance. Strength- and endurance-wise, I felt great. In previous training blocks, anything over 30k was a real struggle, but this time I could hold my desired pace without too much effort.

One issue for me, though (even more so last year), was that training was mostly during winter, where I feel very comfortable. I knew that a 0°C long run in training would feel completely different from almost 20°C on race day with the sun out. While the MP runs felt easy(ish) during training, I knew it would hit much harder during the race.

My initial marathon pace (MP) goal was around 4:51/km (3:25:00 finish), but sometimes 4:40/km felt great during training, so I set some stretch goals.

# Pre-race

I drove to Hamburg one day before the race. Normally, it’s about a three-hour drive from where I live. I was driving an EV and used a charging stop for a quick 5km shakeout run. Traffic into Hamburg was really bad, so I only arrived at my hotel at 6 PM, then went straight to the expo to pick up my bib. I finished the evening with some pasta, oats, and a Maurten 320 mix.  
The next morning, I had toast with jam and another Maurten 160 mix.

# Race

When signing up, I had seeded myself into the 3:30:00 block — in hindsight, not the best decision. I spent the first 8km navigating through the crowd, finally passing the 3:30:00 pacers around the 10km mark (they were struggling to hit pace, too. Why do people seed themselves for 3:30:00 and then run 6:30/km?).

After that, everything went super smooth. I had a Maurten 100 gel every 6km and sipped from the single-use plastic cups at every 5km water station. The cups were hard to squeeze (often broke), so most of the water ended up on my shirt and face — which was actually nice given how brutal the sun was.

I hit the half marathon mark in 1:40:21 (4:45/km) and still had plenty of energy, so I increased my pace to try for negative splits — which initially worked well.

At 30km, I took my fifth gel, but then my stomach started to feel weird. I also struggled to drink much at the aid stations (felt like I might throw up if I ate or drank any more), so I made the (bad) decision to skip further fueling for the final stretch.  
Not sure if it was cardiovascular drift, but my HR kept rising to uncomfortable levels, and I had to reduce my pace. The last 6km were tough, but I managed to keep my pace under 5:00/km — a mental barrier I really didn't want to break.

I crossed the finish line in 3:21:43 (4:46/km), which was better than I had expected before the race — so I’m more than happy.

# Post-race

The finisher zone wasn’t crowded when I arrived, which was a big relief — I could walk a bit to cool down. Last year, I had to stop abruptly, which was not fun.  
There was a nice guy by the water station spraying runners with a hose, which helped a lot.

While still overwhelmed by the result, of course I'm already planning the next race and thinking about what went wrong and how to fix it. I’ll definitely work on my fueling — during training, the colder weather meant I didn’t dehydrate much.  
The good thing for the next training block is that it’ll be summer, so I should be able to simulate race conditions more realistically.

Fun fact: my GPS time was 3:18:57 — once again losing almost 3 minutes for not following the blue line (I was using a Coros Pod for supposedly accurate pace/distance).

# Training

33M: I ran the Chicago Marathon 6 weeks prior to this race, so most of my training can be found in that [race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1g48is3/race_report_2024_chicago_marathon_23234_for/).

After Chicago, my mileage was as follows:

Week 1 (down week): 34 miles  
Week 2: 97 miles  
Week 3: 100 miles  
Week 4: 80 Miles  
Week 5: 70 miles  
Race week: 31 miles prior to race

I was actually pretty surprised with how my body responded after Chicago. By the middle of week 2 I was actually feeling pretty good and hit an 18-miler with some miles at marathon effort. I also managed to get a 22-miler in (with some quicker efforts) during the 100-mile week. This short block went by very quickly, and the taper came before I knew it.

# Pre-race

I was definitely a bit nervous coming into this race for many reasons, but those reasons were mainly: running another marathon right after Chicago, racing on a course with 3x more elevation than Chicago, and racing on a slightly windy day (10 mph).

I was originally in the seeded field for this race, which usually starts in the same corral as the elite field, but this year they split up the seeded runners and the elites since they were offering prize money for the open division. They did give us a choice to move up to elite if we wanted to, so I opted to do that.

I think this was the right choice--the pre-race hospitality (warming tent, private bathrooms, private gear check) really took the stress out of race morning. I really appreciated being able to wear my warmups basically until race time and then being able to pick them back up in the tent after the race. Yeah, I felt like a bit of an imposter, but I'll take these perks any day.

We probably got to the elite tent itself a little before 6 AM. I had time to chat with some folks, eat a banana, and grab a bit more coffee before using the bathroom twice and starting my warmup. I did some dynamic stretches and drills and then got in a short jog in w/ some pickups. Before I knew it, it was time to head to the start line, where we were able to do some strides. We were supposed to start at 7 AM, but it was a little delayed (the half was the day before, too) and so we were off at 7:09!

# Race

I felt pretty good right out of the gate. We had a nice group of guys in my pack from the beginning (maybe 5-6), so these early miles felt pretty good. The energy from the crowds downtown in these first miles is great--I really think Philly is the best big-city marathon in the US outside of the majors (some might even prefer it to the majors), and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a fall marathon. These early miles are pretty flat, so we were just cruising. Hit 5k in 17:37.

The wind was coming from the west on race morning, and this early in the race I wasn't really feeling anything. At about mile 5 we made the turn onto Chestnut and started heading out west into a headwind, but I think we were pretty protected here by the buildings, and I didn't feel the wind much here. Some minimal climbing between 5k and 10k, but nothing crazy. 10k in 35:32.

At this point we still had a pack of about 5 of us, but were starting to spread out just a bit. Heading over the Walnut Street bridge and out toward UPenn is when I really felt the wind for the first time, but it wasn't too bad. This is also the exact moment in which I remembered u/sprodown's shitposting in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1gsvf4r/philadelphia_marathon/): ""The headwinds are only headwinds if you’re slow. Go faster, and they’ll be tailwinds."" Had myself a laugh at this point, which was good, because we were about to start the first real climb as we headed up north. I had fallen a bit off the pack, but managed to reconnect during the climb without wasting too much effort. All the real climbs happen between about 7.5 miles and the halfway point of the race, so I knew if I could make it to half feeling not too beat up from the climbs I'd be in for a decent race. 15k in 53:23.

Mile 10 starts with a short climb, followed by a nice downhill heading right into the biggest climb of the race. I actually handled this section pretty well, but my legs needed a bit of time to get back up to speed as we heading onto Avenue of the Republic. Our pack was pretty split at this point, with a couple of pairs of guys running together and then a couple of us running alone in between (myself included). Despite no longer being in a pack, I could see the guys ahead of me, and this helped a lot with keeping pace. Another climb and crossed halfway in 1:15:45.

I was definitely behind where I wanted to be at this point, but I feeling pretty decent physically and was happy to have made it through all of the serious hills. This part of the course was probably the most boring, though, as I was still running alone and the crowd support was pretty sparse. It's a bit twisty here as you navigate the park, and I much prefer running long, straight stretches of road (it's easier for me to lock in mentally). Huge downhill coming out of park here and heading north, and I split one of my fastest miles (mile 16) here. As I passed \~16.2 I said ""single digits now"" out loud and prepared to lock in for what is always the hardest part (mentally) of the marathon for me: miles 16–20.

As I got onto Kelly Drive, I started to really feel the wind for the first time. I even make some remark about it as I passed my coach along Kelly. ""No problem,"" I told myself, ""I'll have a nice tailwind coming home."" More on that later. 30k in 1:47:54. I was yo-yoing with a guy who had initially passed me as we first got onto Kelly. I think he was dealing with some cramps, but I'm relatively certain that he came out Corral A, so he probably had a finishing time 4-5 minutes faster than me. Regardless, he was keeping a decent pace and was a good person to chase during this stretch.

Heading up into Manayunk is a ton of fun, as the crowds really turn out here and bring a ton of energy. It's really needed at this point, because there is a small climb (maybe 30 ft. or so) that feels a lot bigger than it actually is because of where it's at on the course and because you see folks heading down on the other side as they tackle the last 10k of the race. 20.1 miles in 1:56:25 (random, but I'm pretty sure this corresponds with the turnaround).

I still felt relatively good at the turnaround and was excited for the final part of the race. However, to my surprise, I was hit with what felt like another headwind as I got back onto Kelly heading in the opposite direction. ""What gives?"" I thought. Alas, I remembered u/niceguy542006's words in the Philly thread linked above: ""girding myself for the wonderful headwinds heading out on Kelly Drive, which always seem to also be headwinds coming back from Kelly drive."" Prophetic.

I was starting to fade with 5k to go when I really should have been stepping on the gas. I had a bit of a side stitch that I couldn't kick, which was making breathing a bit more labored than it needed to be. Honestly though, I think I've gotta work on being more mentally tough in the last 10k overall of a race. I was hurting a bit here, but I could have made myself hurt more. 1 mile to go: 2:26:25.

The last half mile has a bit of a climb, which is never fun at the end of a marathon lol. When I could make out the clock, I saw something like 2:31:45 and knew I would just miss my A goal. I managed to close pretty hard and felt like I was absolutely flying in this last mile. It's all relative, obviously, because I split like 5:43 here--faster than my overall average pace, but not by any means my fastest mile of the race.

Crossed the finish in 2:32:08 (chip)--a 26-second PR following a PR at Chicago just 6 weeks earlier! As always, I wanted a bit more on the day, but I've got be happy about another PR after a quick turnaround and racing on a more difficult course!

# What's Next?

So this is 6 marathon PRs in a row dating from Chicago 2022 to now. I have to shout out my coach, Dylan Gearinger, who was out on the course on Sunday and has been great to work with over the past 2.5 years. Great guy, great coach.

I'm going to work on some top end speed this winter before moving into a marathon block. I'm signed up for Project 13.1 in March and am hoping to rip a nasty half on what is an extremely quick course. I know we've got some other folks from this sub signed up as well, so looking forward to seeing you all there. After this, I'm pretty sure I'll do the Jersey City Marathon in April. Looks like a flat and fast course.

Thanks for reading!

# Background

I signed up for Eugene as my sixth marathon (1x Chicago Marathon, 1x NYC Marathon, 3x Marine Corps Marathon) with the goal of hopefully breaking three hours for the first time. I'd previously been to Eugene for the World Athletics Championships and was excited by the idea of going back. I was attracted by the course, average weather, abundant pace groups, and the availability of information about the race on this and other platforms. The ""gimmicky"" elements of the race -- finishing on the Hayward Field track and finisher medals incorporating debris from the historic stadium -- were also admittedly attractive to me as a track nerd.

I have many years of running experience (high school PRs of 1 Mile: 4:59 and 5K: 18:19), but my training has ebbed and flowed in terms of volume and intensity over the years. My previous PR was 3:01:47, run on the Marine Corps Marathon course on a very hot day. In past marathon builds, I have generally followed Hal Higdon's Intermediate plans, with mileage peaking between 50-60 mpw and minimal marathon-specific workouts.

Circa 2020, I had wanted to try a more structured and intense marathon build with the intent to break 3:00. I ultimately got about halfway through the Pfitzinger 18/55 plan before the pandemic cancelled my goal race, which was discouraging and put me off from structured training for quite a while.

After some significant life changes and work circumstances in the intervening years (and one more mediocre marathon build), I decided to give it another go. Hopefully this is useful for anyone else in a similar situation!

# Training

Like I said, I'd previously gotten about halfway through a Pfitzinger 18/55 build before the pandemic cancelled my previous attempt to break 3:00. Heading into this build, I found myself in a more flexible WFH situation and decided to at least try a higher mileage target.

In the weeks leading up to signing up for the race and deciding on a training plan, I gradually built up my average mileage from \~30mpw to 50mpw (right around my previous mileage peaks) and began sprinkling in interval workouts. Finally, I ran a 5K in the first couple weeks of the build (in 18:33) to assess fitness and target workout paces for the build.

Based on my pre-build fitness, I landed on Pfitzinger 18/70 for this build. The mileage targets for this plan were definitely uncharted territory for me, so I went into it with the understanding that I could pivot back to 18/55 if necessary, as I'd had success with that in the past.

Ultimately, I followed Pfitz 18/70 nearly to the letter. The only real hiccups were some bad winter weather early in the build, which caused me to need to skip/slow a couple of early workouts but otherwise I stuck to the overall prescribed mileage and workouts throughout the later stages of the plan.

My workouts went surprisingly well throughout the build, which made me feel confident about the initial goal of breaking 3:00. I think I responded very well to the higher mileage approach and its adaptations.

Over the final month of the build, I ran significant PRs in my tune-up races (13.1: 1:28:02 -> 1:22:15; 10 miles: 64:00 -> 59:40; 5K: 18:19 -> 17:29), which gave me a lot of confidence heading into race day and caused me to reassess my race plan. I'd initially planned to run with the 3:00 pace group, but decided to target the 2:55 pace based on my tune-ups.

# Pre-race

Ultimately, my taper was a little shaky and I ended up getting sick for the week prior amidst some serious non-running related stressors, despite being very cautious (masking, etc.). This was made worse by poor sleep and travel, which was pretty nerve wrecking heading into race day.

All in all, my symptoms were all ""above the neck"" as the old adage goes, my legs felt great, and my wife was fine throughout, which makes me think I had/have some sort of noncontagious sinus or upper respiratory infection that was exacerbated by stress and responded pretty well to therapies. I was able to get through all of my shakeout runs in Eugene just fine, which calmed my nerves a bit.

I barely got any sleep the night before the race, which exacerbated my symptoms and made me extremely nervous on the morning of the race. Honestly, I had no idea how things would go and was prepared for the worst. But, the weather forecast was perfect -- mid 40s / overcast / minimal wind -- and I felt a bit better after some medicine and breakfast, so I decided to stick with the race plan. My warm-up run to the start line felt fine and I lined up with the 2:55 group.

This was easily the smoothest pre-race experience that I've ever had at a marathon. In the past, I've run 'big city' races where you're stuffed into a corral long before the start. This is obviously not ideal and makes it difficult to warm-up and feel ready on the start line.

In Eugene, our AirBnb was just a short jog away, so I didn't need any pre-race Porta-Johns etc. (although these were available and the lines seemed reasonable). At least in Corral A, most people didn't file in until a few minutes before the start, which I appreciated. (Take note race directors: there's no need to crowd everyone in like sardines for 30+ minutes before a race like this!)

# Race

After the gun, I honestly wasn't really prepared for how crowded the early miles would be, despite having consumed a lot of media and recaps about the race. Especially running with the pace group, it could be challenging at times to find good running room in those early miles. Crowd support also exceeded my expectations.

Otherwise, running with the 2:55 group was a great way to manage pace in the first half of my race. Our pacer was excellent, giving lots of information about the course and even Eugene running trivia. (Kudos to Eugene and the pacing crew -- I've run in slower groups in other races that were much more poorly managed. If you're looking for a race with strong pacing, I would definitely recommend Eugene.)

After passing Hayward Field for the second time \~Mile 9/10, we were running just a little hot / ahead of schedule <6:35/mile and the pacer wisely slowed us down a bit. But, as we got to the 13.1/26.2 split on the bike path around Springfield, we split \~6:50 for Mile 11.

By this point, I was feeling a little crowded and instinctively sped up a bit after seeing that split as I'd missed an earlier water station amidst the crowd. A few other people did the same, so I didn't immediately realize I was putting a small gap on the pace group. I was a little apprehensive to run away from the group, but was honestly enjoying having some running room and free air. There was also plenty of traffic, so I didn't feel as if I was running on my own.

In Mile 12, there's a short out-and-back section, which gave me the benefit of being able to see clearly how far ahead of the group I'd gotten. Ultimately, I felt they weren't too far behind and there were even some other small breakaway groups between me and them, so I opted to stay on my pace, figuring that I could always reattach myself to that group if they caught me.

Between Miles 12-\~16, I mostly tried to stay consistent and ran with some folks targeting slightly faster times than me. I'd let them go as they picked up their pace, but it was good to have company for these miles.

I was a little nervous about the back half of the course along the river trails, as some folks have said that the crowd support diminishes here and things can get lonely. Thankfully, this was not my experience at all. To me, it felt like there was a good amount of support throughout the course. (If anything, support *increased* along the river relative to the street sections in Springfield.) I suspect that some of this was due to run clubs and crews cheering on friends and teammates in the front third of the pack, so I can't speak to whether that support diminished over the course of the day.

From \~16-20, I was attached to a great group and kept my pace pretty steady around \~6:35. Around the middle of Mile 20, there's a short incline over the bridge back onto the south side of the river, which ultimately broke our group. But, I felt pretty good at this point and decided to venture on alone.

From here on out, a lot of runners started coming back to me. I didn't have a consistent group to run with, so I tried to focus on running strong through the finish while catching as much of the field as I could. I sped up a bit over this section, but didn't want to overcook myself and risk blowing up in the final 5K.

Over the final mile, I felt strong enough to speed up just a bit to try and squeeze out as much time as I could. One thing I wish I'd known is that your running room gets squeezed a bit over that final mile as the half marathoners re-join the course and the two races are shuffled into pretty skinny funnels for \~800 meters before you turn into Hayward Field, and it can be hard to get around traffic in this section as you're hurting and other marathoners are coming back to you. I probably would have tried to squeeze out a bit more pace on the wide open trails if I'd realized that was coming.

The finish on the track is obviously incredible. I tried to give a small kick here as I'd felt a bit constrained in the few hundred meters prior. A teammate had warned me that the Hayward surface would be the softest finish of a marathon you'll ever experience and it lived up to that. Ultimately, you're not running on the track for too long, but it's a very fulfilling experience and they don't try too hard to shuffle you off once you're past the finish line. I kissed my wife and then went to stretch a bit to take in the experience.

Some other random thoughts/details:

* Fueling: 
   * Carb Boom! Apple Cinnamon Energy Gel (100 Calories) at Miles 4, 8, 12, 20, and 22.
   * Carb Boom! Vanilla Orange Energy Gel (100 Calories) w/ 25mg caffeine at \~15 minutes pre-race and at Mile 16.
   * I don't see many folks using this brand, but I think they're a great dark horse fueling option. Their stuff is relatively low-sugar, good consistency, and taste like ""real"" foods. Check them out!
* I appreciate that the race is unapologetically ""Eugene-y"". 
   * It was a great experience as a track nerd. Running through or past so many iconic sights and trails was awesome. It's not likely that I'd have another opportunity to run, much less race, on the Hayward track. I hope they never get rid of this element of the course. 
   * Ben Blankenship was out on the course hyping everyone up and coaching his own athletes, which was a really cool morale boost as someone who grew up watching him race. Keira D'Amato was brought out by the race post-Boston and was also out on the course cheering. 
   * Again, our pacer was very knowledgeable about the course and the community. It was almost like having a Eugene tour guide in addition to a pacer, which made things more enjoyable and relaxed. 

# Post-race

After getting through all of the finish chutes, I reunited with my wife who was watching in the stands. I was pretty exhausted by this point -- I changed into warmer clothes and then sat on the concourse for a while. During the race, I honestly didn't experience many illness symptoms at all and felt fine in the immediate aftermath. We moved back into the stands to watch others finish and take in the stadium as I had my post-race beer and snacks and messaged some teammates back home.

I'd expected to crash post-race due to lack of sleep, but the adrenaline kept me up for the rest of the day. We walked back to the AirBnb, had some lunch, and relaxed for a while before an early dinner and drinks at McMenamins.

A few days out at this point, my body feels pretty trashed and I figure I've prolonged the infection recovery, but I'm proud to have executed this race above and beyond my expectations.

### Training
After my November marathon, where I missed my BQ by 7 seconds, I wanted a repedemption race to get a good 5 minute buffer. I chose Jim Thorpe for the fabulous course profile, and the timing was about as soon as I could get another good training block while still taking advantage of the srpring weather. 

Training started off poorly, as it took me longer to recover from November and a mild bout of covid than anticipated. A few tough early weeks with a slow 2 mile time trial and a scuddled race pace long run got me in the dumps. Fortunately, that was a low point that gave way to a series of fantastic runs, workouts, and a tune up 10 Miler with a 2 minute PR that instilled a lot of confidence. I followed a plan from a local run coach who oversees group workouts every Wednesday on the local university track. Basically it consistented of speed work on Wednesday, each weekend was either a long, slow run or a slightly shorter tempo or pace run, with various combinations of MP, half marathon pace, and faster. This culminated in a tough 17 miler with lots of fast distance. My longest runs were a few 20 and a single 22 miler at zone 2. I peaked at two, 60 mile weeks and was thriving at that. 

Then I caught a cold from my daughter 9 days out from race day that ended up being more persistent than I had hoped. Mild fever and body aches suggest it could have been RSV or a mild flu, but whatever it was it left me sluggish all week and scuttled my well planned taper. 

### Pre-race
I checked the weather obsessively while recovering and was happy to see that race conditions were going to be sweet: 45F at the start, though ending in the low 60s with sun. I drove up to the race city hoping that my now mild symptoms were a good omen. I had a nice 2 mile shakeout run on the first two miles of the course and got to bed early. I had done a good carb load for the past 3 days and was cautiously optimistic for race day. I woke up eager to run, kept my Wordle streak going, had a half a bagel with jam and a caffeinated Maurten gel and headed to the race. 

### Race
While I can give plenty of excuses for the cold, I made the cardinal sin of marathon racing: I went out too fast. My plan was to start slow at 7:30 per mile and ease into race pace, 7:00, by mile 2-3. The good weather, the lack of pacers, and the obvious race day excitement chucked that out the window, with several early miles that were far too fast. I knew it, but I couldn't rein myself in. It's easy to say ""go out slowly"" but it's so hard to follow that simple advice. 

By mile 7 I knew I was in trouble. I was simply feeling too tired for what should have been the cruising section of the course. I was at target pace by then and was deluding myself into the ""banked time"" fallacy: ""Ok just stay at this pace and you'll be good"". But my HR and general aerobic feeling foretold of the troubles to come. 

The race course was beautiful. I was enjoying the scenary and trying to stay optimistic. The course goes gently downhill, about 30 feet per mile, in a beautiful gorge in the Poconos of PA. The other item of note about the course was the substrate: packed gravel. While a generally good surface, the tiny amount of slippage on each foot strick I think added up to a bit too much effort. 

Miles 15-26 were... not great. I was slow and I knew I was on the downward spiral. I just couldn't keep my heart rate down and I struggled. Compared to my previous two marathons, I was too tired, too early. The only thing that felt good were my quads- previous races this was one of my weak points, but lots of good strength and speed work have resulted in strong legs, for which I am thankful. I shifted to a run/walk interval of doing roughly 30 seconds at each mile, or a bit more by the end. It was not pretty(I'm not bashing run/walk, but it wasn't part of my plan today) but I was proud of myself for the tough run. 

### Post-race
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't at all disappointed, but honestly I'm less frustrated than I thought I would be. I loved the course, I KNOW I've got a BQ in me, and my depleted cardio state slowed me down enough so that I'm less beaten up than my last race (or maybe it's the shoes: newish Endorphin Speed 4s have been great!). So after I take some good weeks of recovery, I'm eager to get back to it. 

Boston 2025 is looking very unlikely, though I'll be pondering a few September races for the next few weeks. I'm already signed up for the Disney marathon in January, which is the most fun I have ever had as an adult. While it's not known as a fast race because of all the photo stops on the course, it is flat and starts before sunrise for decent weather.

Feedback is welcome: but if you tell me that I went out too fast I'm just going to reply: ""Thank you, Captain Obvious :)""

### Background
I’m 42M, 6’1”/162 pounds, a former D1 collegiate runner (though a relative scrub on a national-champion team). I kept up running a few years after college, and ran my first marathon at Big Sur in 2007 (6th overall in 2:44, but the race was such a blur because I went out too fast and bonked so that I didn’t feel like I made the most of the experience). I stopped running much in 2010 when I got injured but couldn’t afford physical therapy. I had a few false starts over the years, but calf issues would crop up. In December 2023, I had what I like to think of as a “positive mid-life crisis” as I realized I wasn’t actually a runner anymore, and at 41 I  may never be one again unless I changed things, urgently! I committed myself to getting back into running shape, and within 12 weeks went from running 50 miles in all of 2023 to running 50+ miles a week… and promptly got a stress fracture in my foot. Maybe a bit too quick of a rampup! After that healed, I was a bit more careful and slowly started to build back my fitness and lose my extra weight in a long buildup to my hometown Baltimore Marathon in October 2024 (mostly following Pfitz 18/55 peaking in the 60’s mpw). I needed a lot of PT appointments for calf and hamstring issues, but made it to the startline. That race went fantastic, giving it my all to run 2:47. I signed up for another race to keep the psyche up, and chose Big Sur again to try to fully appreciate the Big Sur beauty in a way I missed in 2007.

### Training
After the Baltimore marathon, I had a nice base-building phase in the fall to get ready for a full Pfitz 18/70 cycle, which kicked off around Christmas. The first 5 weeks went great... until I suddenly became the sickest I have ever been in my life. I thought it was just a nasty cold until it got to the point where I could barely breathe, due to what turned out to be a massive clot of bacteria in my lungs (pneumonia). I’m sure it would have killed me in a few days if left alone—thank goodness for the invention of antibiotics! I had lost 12 pounds in 7 days (down to 150lb), was hacking up foul material for weeks, and my heart rate was through the roof when walking up the stairs. Basically, once cleared by my doctor torun again, I was starting back at fitness-square one with just 9 weeks to go to the race. The first weeks back of ~25mi felt way harder than any 60+ mpw weeks I’ve done. I purely focused on “easy” base running, but my heart rate would still quickly jump to LT rate or above! Over the next few weeks, I focused on building back up a long run and getting a bit of LT work (got in 4 long runs over 19mi with hills and pacework and worked my LT pace from 6:20 down to 5:50/mi) and peaked at 72mi 3 weeks before the race. I was also afflicted with, <ahem> “runner’s trot” issues from the antibiotics for the rest of the training cycle (and was very worried about how many pit-stops I might need during the race!). Overall, I still felt weaker than I had in mid-January, but felt strong enough to put in a good effort, whatever that pace may be. I set a goal of top 25 overall to give me something a little scary but possible to shoot for, especially since the racetimes are so dependent upon the conditions.

### Pre-race
My family flew to California the week before the race for Spring Break/grandparent time for the kids.Did my final tuneup workout at 5:45/mi pace and finally starting feeling like my old pre-sickness self. We went down to Monterey the day before the race, and my kids went to the aquarium with grandparents while I went to the expo and did a shakeout. Had an early dinner of sea-bass and risotto, and was asleep by 9pm. Woke up at 3am to scarf down a banana and bagel with PB&J and a Skratch labs high carb drink. Was dropped off at the bus at 4am and stared at the darkness as we traveled the disturbingly long way to the start line. I thought: “Am I really going to racing this whole way back?!?”. Had a Gu stroopwaffel and coffee at 5:30, a 5minute warmup jog in the rain, took a gu and lined up a couple rows back from the front of Corral A.
Race Outfit: Nike aeroswift singlet, Bandit Superbeam quartertights, alphafly 3’s.
Race Nutrition: gu 15min before start, 160g Maurten’s at 4.8mi and 12mi, and a 100g Maurten’s Caff at ~17mi. I grabbed a cup on Nuun’s drink mixture at every water stop. Didn’t bonk!

### Race
Since I had no real idea of my ultimate fitness, I went totally by feel through the ups and downs of the beautiful, wet, windy, hilly course! Started with 4 downhill in foggy redwoods, then cutting to the coast with a gentle uphill with a mighty headwind, quick downhill then a steep 2mile climb to hurricane point, Bixby Bridge, and many miles of rolling hills on the way to Carmel. Felt like I had Ireland’s pastoral hills on the right and Kauai’s sea cliffs on the left! Then rolling cambered hills by rich peoples’ homes in the Carmel Highlands, then on to the finish (though the last section was a bit of a blur to be honest). I started near the front of the field and tried to stay relaxed through the first downhill miles. In my 40’s, it takes longer for my heart rate to ramp up and to be able to handle faster paces, so I focused on being smooth (avoiding needless braking on the downhills) with controlled breathing.  Once warmed up and onto the flats and gentle uphills of miles 5-9, I upped the perceived effort into the headwind as we headed to the coast and pulled away from the runners nearby and was soon basically alone with a big gap ahead and behind (I was basically alone in the marathon from miles 7-23). I focused on keeping my heart rate under 160 on the hills to keep from burning myself out too early (like I had done in 2007). The 2 mile Hurricane Point climb itself wasn’t too bad, especially with a much gentler 2nd mile. I was well-prepared from my hilly long runs to handle Hurricane point; rather I saved all of my groans for the random hills thrown in all over the course that didn’t even seem to exist on the course map’s elevation profile. I came through the halfway point at 1:22-high and felt good ticking off the miles for a while, before the cumulative downhill pounding on the quads really started to set in. My left hamstring, right calf and especially left quad started to bark at me around miles 16-18, to where I preferred the uphills to the downhills the rest of the race! I knew the total elevation gain is ~+2100ft, so I tried to trick myself into relishing the uphills, since each step up was another foot of elevation chopped off the to-do list. On the other hand, every step downhill for the last 8 miles elicited a little “ow” from my quads, but stayed manageable as long as I reigned in the pace. For the last 10k of the race, I was definitely limited by how much pounding my legs could take versus my cardiovascular limit, with my heart rate dropping well below threshold. I simply tried to manage as fast as my legs themselves could take, and was pleasantly surprised that I was still clicking off low 6’s/mile (my grade-adjusted pace was ~6:10/mi for miles 18-23).
The 21-miler race started ahead of us on the same course, so I was constantly passing walkers and joggers, but couldn’t tell where any fellow marathon racers were. Evidently I passed a few in the last 10k without realizing it! At mile ~21, I recognized a fellow marathon runner up ahead, a 5-time winner here and a fellow competitor in the Master’s division, so I focused on reeling him in (he was looking like he was paying the price for a too-quick first-half). I slowly got closer, gobbling up the gap on uphills, while losing a bit on all the downhills.  I passed him on a hill around mile 23, without a fight, but then disaster struck half a mile later, when my left hamstring suddenly cramped up and stopped me dead in my tracks. The exact same muscle cramp, at the same distance as during the Baltimore marathon last fall! After about a minute and several attempts to get it stretched out, it finally released enough to get running again, though my competition had re-passed me in the meantime. Surprisingly, the hamstring felt almost-normal again by mile 24, and I could resume racing after my competition. I briefly passed him again around mile 25, but this time he was properly in on the fight and he flew by me again on the downhill, and held the lead to the final straight. I cashed in all my remaining reserves to kick hard and sprinted past him to take the master’s crown, and 4th place overall. Official time of 2:44:44, slight negative split, and tantalizingly close to the 2:44:28 I ran here as a much younger man in 2007! More importantly, I kept my head up and enjoyed the race much more than in my youth. The course was tough, but as slow as I would have thought, I could have managed maybe 5min faster on a flat, windless course. The wind and uphills were manageable, but what really cost me was the pounding downhill, especially needing to use my quads to brake a bit to maintain control on the wet, cambered roads while weaving between walkers in wobbly alphaflys (with a popped air pod to boot).

### Post-race
After the race, I high-fived my family and waddled over to the tent to collect my gear and get into warmer clothes, enjoying the runner’s high of a race well-executed. The race organizers did an amazing job all weekend, best-organized race I’ve ever done, highly recommend it for anybody’s race bucket list. I forced myself to eat a bit of food, enjoyed a beer, and soaked up the vibes until the award ceremony kicked off. I ended up with 3 award plaques, for overall place, winning my 40-44 age group, and winning the overall Master’s category (40+). I followed another dad’s example and brought up my kids with me on stage for my awards—there was a very wholesome r/daddit crossover with us 3,4,5th place finishers all with our little kids, who were beyond pumped to be in front of a crowd! My quads and hamstrings are still super-fried as I type this on the airplane, and I have to steel myself when I’m confronted with a staircase, but I’m relishing that too as a sign of mischief-well-managed! Considering how bleak things looked 9 weeks ago, I’m deliriously happy with how my body rebounded and how the race progressed. My mini mid-life crisis last year has transformed my body and attitude, and helped me recapture my love of running.  Now I need to make up for lost time while I still can and get in a few proper pneumonia-free training cycles to carry me to Boston 26 and beyond!

### Training
46M, 5’9’’, 165 lbs. 
Started running about 2 years ago as an attempt to lose weight. I was ~195 lbs then. Started with a c5k program and quickly fell in love with running and was able to shed 30 lbs since. 
Completed my first HM with 1:55 finish time Oct. 2024 and felt really good. A friend convinced me to try a full marathon and I signed up for the 2025 Napa Valley Marathon. 
For the training, I was following the Pfitz 18-55 plan plus 2x body weight strengthening a week. At the beginning the intensity of the plan felt too demanding for me, so I had to tune down some of the hard workouts. After 2 months of training, I found that I was able to keep up with the planned workouts. Mileage wise, I was quite strictly following the plan. My pace steadily improved with the training. 1 month out, Garmin predicted a sub 4hr marathon finish time. Things went really well until 3 weeks out from the race day. 2 days after my last 20 mile long run, I was doing the V8 w/ 5 x 600 @ 5K pace workout as planned. About 3 miles into the run, I felt a sharp pain on the outside of my right knee. I stopped running and basically walked back home. After some research, It felt most likely an IT Band issue. I read many of the posts on this subreddit and took some of the best advice (so a big THANK YOU here!) including rest for the last 3 weeks, specific strengthening routines, massages and stretches, KT Tapes, IT Band strap and Tylenol.  In the last 3 weeks, I only ran easy short distances once or twice a week just to test the recovery progress. 2 days before the race, I did a 3 mile run and my knees felt good. So I made the decision to give it a try.

### Pre-race
The hotels close to the starting line of NVM were really expensive, so I booked a hotel in Fairfield which is about 20 mins drive to the Vintage High School from where you can take the race shuttle to the starting line. 
I went to bed at 9:30PM and woke up at 4AM. Had 2 slices of bread with peanut butter and 2 cups of coffee for breakfast. Left the hotel at around 5AM and arrived at Vintage High School at 5:25. There were quite a lot of buses waiting. It took around 40 minutes for the bus to get to the starting line. Runners can stay in the bus to keep warm. The lines for the potties were around 15-20 minutes. In general, the race logistics were well run and things were quite smooth.
### Gears
New Balance SC Elite V4

Maurten gels: M160x4, M100x3

14oz handheld soft flask with Electrolyte

I was planning to use the ASICS MetaSpeed Sky Paris for the race because they gave me the best running efficiency from all the shoes I tested during my Sunday long runs. However, due to the IT Band issue, I decided to go with SC Elite. My thoughts were if the IT Band flares up during the race, SC Elite may provide better comfort and support to help me finish the race with pain. Other shoes I tested includes:

Adios Pro 4: they were too soft and even though they felt bouncy, it felt a little undirected and unreliable. So in the last several miles of my long run, my legs felt quite tired.

SC Elite V4: they are really comfortable and cushion, also very wide therefore most stable among the shoes. But compared to Sky Paris, they lacked the pop or energy return.

### Race
I took 1 gel 20 mins before the start time. I started with the 4:15 pacer group since I was worried about my knees. 3 miles later, my body felt pretty good, so I slowly picked up pace to around 9 min/mile. The course was really scenic and the weather was perfect: no sun, no rain, no wind and temp was mid 40. I felt really good before half way. Right after the 13 mile sign, I felt the urge to pee, so I spent around 30 seconds in the potty. There were potties on every water station, and no line after around 10 miles. After the 14 mile sign, I felt a minor pain on the outer side of my right knee again. I slowed down a bit and took a pill of Tylenol. I kept running, but slowed down a bit for the next 3-4 miles because of both worrying about the knee and also rolling hills. Soon, I passed the 20 mile sign. I realized that the pain never showed up again and I felt pretty good: no sign of hitting the wall, legs felt ok too. So I started to pick up my pace again. I actually ran the last 5 miles with ~8:45 min pace and finished 4:02. I brought 7 gels with me and took 1 gel every 3 or 4 miles. I also took a cup of water from each water station. I think this fueling strategy worked really well for me and maybe the main reason I didn’t hit the wall. 

### Post-race
I’m super happy and proud for the successful finish of my first marathon, especially that I was able to finish 4:02 3 weeks after the minor IT Band issue. I felt quite good after the race. IT Bands felt okay, no pain while I was walking or going up and down the stairs. Legs were pretty beaten up and very sore, but a lot better than I expected. 
Next step? I’m going to take a month break and then start a 5K/10K training block. After that, I may sign-up for my second marathon later this year or early next year.

Thank you all for reading. I want to thank everyone in the community for all the motivation, discussion and race reports that helped me tremendously since I started running seriously.

This was my second marathon, and overall it was an exhilarating experience.

**Pre-Race:**

I flew to Phoenix on Friday morning. The race expo had great vibes and was very well organized—with clear signage everywhere. I picked up my bib in just five minutes and even attended a course analysis seminar led by a coach, which proved super helpful.

For dinner, I kept it simple: sushi, water, plain bagels, bananas, and a few other light items. Despite my preparations, I still had trouble falling asleep because of the timezone difference.

I set my alarm for 3:30 a.m. The bus loading time for the marathon was scheduled between 4:00 a.m. and 5:15 a.m., and we were advised to be on the bus by 4:45 a.m. Unsure of what traffic might be like, I built in an extra 20-minute buffer. Although I had a restless night and woke up several times, I managed to rise before the alarm went off. I fueled up with a small cup of coffee, one bagel, one banana, and a Honey Stinger energy waffle.

There were plenty of buses available, and our ride took about 30 minutes. I appreciated being able to stay on the bus during the two-hour wait—during that time, I even managed to catch an extra hour of sleep after everyone disembarked.

I encountered long lines at the portable toilets, but I just made it in time to join the 3:25 pace group. After the national anthem and a burst of fireworks, we sprinted to the starting line.

**During the Race:**

* **Miles 1–4:** The race started with a smooth, downhill stretch. The atmosphere was buoyant, and I maintained a steady pace of 7:45 per mile while chatting with fellow runners.
* **Miles 5–6:** This section featured the only uphill portion of the course. Although the elevation gain was modest, I definitely felt the impact. In hindsight, I should have slowed down by 10–15 seconds per mile rather than trying to maintain the same pace.
* **Miles 7–12:** The course then transitioned to mostly downhill and flat terrain. The enthusiastic crowds, complete with funny signs, created a fantastic local atmosphere that I thoroughly enjoyed.
* **Miles 13–20:** I took some salt stick pills and was comfortably holding my pace. However, my calves began to spasm, forcing me to slow down and adjust my cadence several times.
* **Miles 22–24:** Luckily, the calf spasms subsided. When I glanced at my watch, I realized my personal record (PR) goal was at risk, so I started picking up the pace.
* **Miles 25–Finish:** By this point, I was breathing heavily, my arms were swinging, and I was running on all cylinders. As soon as I saw the finishing line, I launched into a mad dash, crossing it with a time of **3:29:53**! 9 min PR ! I was ecstacic. 

**Post-Race:**

The post-race drink party was a blast, with plenty of beers and drinks to enjoy. After gathering my gear bag, I noticed many streets were still closed, so I ran back to my hotel at a very relaxed pace.

**Final Thoughts:**

My fueling and hydration strategy worked very well this time—I took six gels, stopped at every aid station for Gatorade, and took salt stick pills twice. One area for improvement is incorporating more tempo runs into my training schedule. Also, losing 5 lbs of body fat definitly helped! "

This was my first time running the US Olympic Trials. I’m still trying to pinpoint exactly when it was that I first heard about the Trials Marathon. I think I may have been a sophomore in high school, some 12 years ago, being told that anyone who ran under a certain time competed all on the same course to select who represented the United States at the Olympics. It’s not like this in every country. In fact, many countries just have a selection committee rather than racing the top contenders against each other. Now, in reality, there are maybe a dozen or two athletes who actually have a shot at making that team, and especially with the new convoluted rules surrounding Olympic Qualification, it’s only complicated that matter. However, one of the things that remains about this race is that every four years, all of the best marathon runners in the US toe the same line and run the same race. The annual US marathon championship race is lucky if even one or two of the top 10 best racers in the country show up, and the energy just isn’t quite there. But this race is different. If you run under the qualifying standard and are healthy enough to be on the line, you ARE there.
  

  
I won’t go into the details of qualifying for this race, as my last race report already went in depth about that. However, I’ll start this story from where the last one left off.
  

  
I took two weeks “off” (sparsely did some easy runs of 30 minutes or less here and there) before starting up a 14 week build for the trials. My training was hardly glamorous, save for a 17-day stretch where I ran a total of 316 miles, the highest volume 2 week stretch of training I had ever done. A normal week consisted mostly of very easy volume (anywhere from 7:20-7:45/mi avg pace), two workouts (generally on Saturday and Monday to take advantage of my school districts 4-day workweek from Tues-Fri which I am incredibly fortunate to have), and one somewhat moderate effort run on Thursdays that consisted of some light fartlek reps or just strides and some faster running at closer to 6:00/mi pace. I documented every week of my training on my instagram, so if you are interested in seeing a week-by-week breakdown and a few deeper insights here and there you can find me at @alexander.burks, or on my strava which I linked at the top.
  

  
The overall race experience was really cool. Flights were reimbursed and our hotels/catered meals were paid for. All of the athletes stayed in the same hotel, so there were lots of professional athletes around. Thankfully at this point I had been on the circuit a few times and had found myself mingling with a few professional groups early enough that rather than being starry-eyed or intimidated it was more so just neat to check off the last few athletes from my list that I hadn’t already met or raced against. I was also fortunate to be able to coordinate picking my roommate at my hotel, and got to stay with my good friend Zach Ornelas. I had roomed with Zach at other races, so the familiarity really helped not only with the routine, but having some who I genuinely enjoyed being around. The day before the race primarily consisted of shaking out the legs, taking a bus tour, getting in plenty of calories and carbs at each meal, dropping off my bottles, having my gear checked for logos, and attending a technical meeting about race day logistics. The day felt surprisingly full which ended up being a blessing as it left relatively little time for me to think deeply about the race. I already knew my strategy at this point: it was going to be hot, and since my goal was to place as high as possible, a conservative start would greatly benefit me.
  

  
Race morning logistics were easy. I woke up around 7:30am, possibly getting the most sleep I’ve ever had the night before a marathon. Start time was 10:10am on the dot and we were bussed over around 8:30. I spent most of the time in the athlete area just sitting around chatting with the other athletes I knew, wishing them good luck and such. With 45minutes to go I did my 10 minutes of jogging back and forth over the .4mi stretch of road that was blocked off as our warmup area. With 15 minutes before the start we were walked over to the starting line. I found the friends I was planning on running with for as long as possible, did a light stride or two, and after a powerful national anthem, we were off.
  

  
I knew that the starting line adrenaline would get to some people and their race plans would jump out the window, so I just made sure that I wasn’t one of those people. I didn’t even bother to try and pace out any sort of perfect time for the first mile, as that would just result in unnecessary stress, so I took it in a real nice and easy 5:28, which landed me squarely in the caboose of the race. After the field stretched out a little bit more I easily found a rhythm right around 5:20/mi, which was the pace I had planned to run for the first 4-5 miles. There were timing mats every mile, so doing some quick math I was able to see the point where I finally dipped below a 5:20 pace average, and settled into goal race pace, which essentially happened around the 6 mile mark. At this point I had already taken down my first bottle, a mix of about ⅖ of a packet of Maurten 320, some amount of a Nuun energy tablet, and half of a ketone shot. I knew that fueling and fluids were going to be absolutely crucial to my performance, and thankfully it was very easy for me to grab my bottle, and also get additional support from the general fueling stations along the course. Personal fluids were available every 4 miles start at mile 2.2, and general stations were every 2 miles along the 8 mile loop that we did 3 times after an initial 2.2 mi starting section.
  

  
I made sure to take a water bottle at every single general fluid station, not only to take a small sip and keep myself hydrated, but mainly to pour on my head, the back of my neck, and splash in my face to keep myself from getting too warm. While it wasn’t super comfortable to run with a wet racing kit, I knew it would be much worse to run any portion of the race overheated. I was also confident that my training regimen of post exercise hot water immersion (read more info here: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31555140/) had left me ready for the temperatures that were going to be reached on the day. As we made it through the first lap things remained pretty uneventful. I took my first caffeine gel from a general fluid station around mile 9, made a few casual remarks to the friend(s) I was running with, and soaked in the experience of running at the US Olympic Trials. The crowds as we entered downtown Orlando at the start/end of each loop were ROARING and rather than taking that adrenaline and using it to speed up, I just used it to make my current pace of \~5:15/mi feel as easy as possible.
  

  
The second loop featured the half marathon mark, also complete with a clock to let us know our halfway split. I could tell heading past the 13 mile marker that my HM time was going to be a little slower than I had anticipated/hoped for before the race, but the intensity of the sun was greater than it had been the day prior, and so I figured an even more conservative first half could only help. 69:21 clicked off as I glided through the “uphill” stretch of the course, which with the upper 60 degree F temps and decent humidity (at least compared to Colorado where I train) made it feel like a true uphill. I figured that as long as I held pace through the remainder of the second 8 mile loop, I could maybe make a hard push through the remainder of the course. I took another caffeine gel at mile 16-ish, split two of my fastest miles of the day on the downhill in the shade leading into the final loop, and this time used the energy of the crowd to get me pumped up for one last lap around.
  

  
By this point, the sun was absolutely GLARING, and the temps were right around 70 degrees F. I still felt okay in the heat due to staying ahead of my hydration, electrolytes, and keeping myself doused in water, but the sun was definitely starting to sap a bit of my energy away. Nevertheless, I persisted at a good clip, not checking my watch but instead concentrating on keeping a good, honest effort. The “hill” reared its ugly head again and definitely took a bit of wind out of my sails. Instead of trying to maintain the same pace, I focused on at least moving faster than those around me, but not using more energy than necessary. My rationale was that even if this portion of the race was a bit slower, losing 10-15 seconds to the hill would be way better than crashing and burning, and potentially leaving minutes on the table. My strategy seemed to pay off, as I continued my trend of passing people that had been going since halfway. I was well within 5 miles remaining and took one last caffeine gel from an aid station as a last-ditch effort to turbocharge my finish.
  

  
The caffeine hit my system within minutes, and I fine-tuned my mental focus to be on one thing - passing as many people as possible. I didn’t know it at the time, but I had moved up 50 places since the halfway point, all the way from 119th to 69th (nice) by mile 22. I could see that the caliber of runner I was passing was slowly getting more and more elite, and occasionally, I would recognize a face or jersey. “That guy has run 61 in the half, and that dude is a sub-2:10 marathoner!” These thoughts only made me more and more excited as I continued to find ways to dig deeper and deeper into the pain cave. With 2.2 miles to go, I had moved all the way up into 58th place. While I was not moving any faster than I had all race, the conditions and people's race strategies had taken their toll, and I was passing folks like they were standing still. I could still see several people in front of me who looked like they were within range, but I was running out of time to chase them down. Thankfully, this was the slightly shaded, downhill section of the course, so I figured I could really give it my all and make one last push to see if I could get top 50.
  

  
Now you have to remember at this point that at no part of the race did I know anything about what place I was in, but given the history of the trials, and the strength of this field, I knew it was going to take more than usual to crack into the top-50 and hit my highest possible goal for the trials. That being said, while I knew Atlanta was rough due to the wind and hills, I figured Orlando had a higher probability of having dropouts and blowups, so I figured around a 2:18-flat would still be enough to make a go for a pretty good placement. I could tell I was on pace to be in the mid-2:18s, so at this point, every single placement I could get ahead mattered. Mile 25 was my fastest mat split of the race, being good for a 5:08. The final stretch was a very slight uphill, but I knew I had the energy left in me to still hit it good and hard. I was trying to see if I could make out any last recognizable faces to really motivate me to kick hard. Shadrack Kipchirchir? Yes please! I used the thought of running down an Olympian and the energy of the crowd to take down seven more runners before reaching the final 800m, and while Shadrack was the most obviously recognizable, I knew that at this point every one of these guys were national-caliber athletes, and probably had wayyyy faster PRs than me to boot. The final stretch to the finish line came before the mat for 26 miles, and I could see one last person running in front of me who I figured was within striking range. For all I knew this could be finisher number 50, and beating him could be the difference between feeling like I achieved my relatively arbitrary numeric goal or not, so I gear up for one, last, push.
  

  
But in that exact moment, there was one last thing I wanted to do. Time slowed down a bit in that moment, and I made sure that all of my mental energy was focused on taking in the feeling in that exact moment. As you can imagine, the crowd in the final 800m of the US Olympic Trials was WILD. You could FEEL the cheers and sense the energy. I knew that if I get another chance at this event, it would be a long 4 years before that day comes, and more than anything, I wanted to take the time to enjoy it. So from 800m-600m to go, I motioned to the crowd to really go wild, and the feeling of being able to increase the energy and sense people getting louder and more excited as I waved my arms to them was absolutely electric.
  

  
But there was still work to be done. With 600m to go I directed my focus back to catch the last competitor within striking distance. I finally let everything loose, upped my cadence as high as it would go, and sprinted the last 400m at a mat-timed 4:40/mi pace. I saw the clock flash a high-2:18:20, possibly 28 or 29? And then turned my attention to not stepping on the sand-covered piles of vomit at the finish (the largest of which I later found was courtesy of Rupp). It was a weird feeling. I was excited, but I had no idea what my finish had netted me as placement. I knew I had come out and executed, but what did it all really mean? I was quickly motioned through the mixed zone (no reporter cared about me, lol) and went to go retrieve my bag. I started to get a sense of the finishing order. Mantz was there with a gold medal, so I quickly gave him a fist bump and congratulated him, Reed had placed top-10 which I was super stoked for, so I made sure to talk with him a bit, but it wasn’t until I saw a race official showing his phone to a couple of guys I was friends with that I finally found out where I landed.
  

  
I quickly scrolled down past the first page, assuming I was not in the top 25. When I saw that the second page started with 26th place in the mid 2:16s, I started to realize I had probably done it, and right there on page 2 was A. Burks, bib 542, seeded 144th, finished 43rd overall. Runners who knew me from the Colorado scene graciously congratulated me, knowing the struggles I went through just to qualify. It was so surreal. Guys who placed in front of me, some of which 4 years ago I would have only known from seeing on social media, letting me know what an accomplishment I had just achieved. As others came in that had finished behind me, the well-wishes continued. It was truly an experience unlike any other. The marathoning scene at a national level is such an amazing group of people, and I’m so thankful to have been let into it as a guy who “only” has a PR of 2:16:51. The rest of the night, the others I knew who had dropped out continued to be gracious. Hugs were exchanged, stories were told, and I enjoyed every single minute of it.
  

  
After I made my way out of the athlete area I met up with my wife and dad, who brought me to where my mom, in-laws, and others who had come out to cheer me on were waiting. I hadn’t been able to pick them out from the crowd during the race, but they didn’t care. We were all just celebrating together as more people came up to let me know other facts about the race, like that I was the 2nd highest finisher who was part of a D3 college running program, and how my other friends that I didn’t catch in the athlete area finished. As the adrenaline wore off, I found myself in desperate need of food. So I went back to the athlete hotel, where I washed the grime away, and got ready for the two weeks of reflection, gratitude, and rest.
  

  
It’s truly crazy to me that a little over a year ago I was at the finish line of CIM considering quitting the pursuit of my dream of an OTQ, and now here I am having placed higher at the Olympic Trials than I ever did at a D3 XC National meet (never qualified for indoor or outdoor track nationals). I have so many people to thank, but the biggest thank yous go out to my coach, Ben Wach, for providing me with the training and guidance to make it this far, my parents for always being supportive of me chasing my crazy dreams, and my friends, who help me to stay sane and grounded while working and training in a delicate balance. This has gotten pretty long, so in the spirit of trying to go a TL;DR I’ll just wrap everything up with one last statement:
  

  
“Keep the dream alive”
  

  
Thanks for reading.

1cfj1um,2024-04-28 22:27:01+00:00,Previous-Direction13,,Marathon_Training,/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1cfj1um/race_report_big_sur_2024_out_and_back_route/,Race Report : Big Sur 2024 (out and back route),"I just finished Big Sur. It was my third marathon over the past 2.5 years. This year, of note, its an out and back from Carmel as opposed to the point to point from Big Sur due to a road collapse. Its the third time in 20ish years they have had to do an out and back. It is a precarious road so it will happen again. So this post could be useful.

First of all, the out and back is generally considered easier. This might not be universally agreed, but i spent some time talking to a guy in the route who has run this race every year since 2000. All three out and backs and 20ish normal routes. I am going to trust his opinion; original route (2100 feet up, 2500 feet down) is harder than 1850 up and down. That being said, out and back was a very very hard run. As i said, only three marathons under my belt so i am not mr experience. But trained harder, i am faster, i ran harder... And its my slowest marathon. My legs are positively dead. I trained hills as much as i could and it was not enough.

I knew the hills were coming. That is on the website. What i have not seen noted anywhere is that at many many points the road is heavily banked left to right or right to left to help speedy cars stay on the road. As a runner, its awkward to run on the left to right slant. I dont know how to train that besides running across driveways... But that added to the difficulty.

Today was a beautiful day. The weather was as good as could be asked... But its still windy on a northern California coast. This aint San Diego beaches. The headwinds take their toll. Refreshing if its a little warmer, but the hill with a headwind makes it that much funner. And todays winds were lighter than usual.

The route was extremely well supplied with hydration stations. Support staff was amazing. I never saw a wait on the porta potties, although, pride point is i have not used one in three runs.

They call out a strict 6 hour cutoff. They do use the 6 hour pacer as a sort of sweeper. I think if you fall behind late you might get a teeny bit of extra time. With the road close anyhow i suspect the rush to reopen highway 1 is less urgent. The 21 mile option is a solid option for those less confident. Even though my PR is 4:38 last December, I was worried about the 6 hours and i would still be worried about it on the normal route.

Training : I was 35 mile weeks with 1000 to 1500 feet of elevation a week and a Yoga+elliptical day. One week i got over 2000. Long runs i alternated between going for length vs going for more elevation and capping by effort rather than length. So one weeken i might run a long run with 19 miles and 5 or 600 feet of gain. The next i might run only 13 but with 1200 feet of gain... Same time and effort commitment. Depending on my long run direction i would alternate mid week runs the other way. I did very little speed work as i was focusing on elevation. One note... For me elevation means getting in a car for a teeny bit. What i found as an alternative is using over and under passes and just running back and forth like a mad man.

I actually strained my Soleus with 5 weeks to go so i ended up with a 5 week taper with no runs over 8 miles over the last 5. I suspect that did eat at my leg fitness a little. 

Results : I was solid until mile 16, running at PR pace. Cardio was fine, i was not breathing hard and my heart rate was fine. As i said, i needed more hill training. Hamstrings went in 16th mile then all hell broke loose. My Soleus held until mile 21ish day of. By then i was running like a weird character from a B horror movie. I finished 4:50 and i am fine with it. It was an amazing experience that i am proud of. I see a lot of posts about aspirational random times that they got from some post on the Internet as a ""good"" time. A run like today is why the simple number does not tell the story. 

Cheers!

# Background

I’m a 37 year old male and started running somewhat consistently in the fall of 2023. Before that I can't remember having run more than 3 miles or ever running faster than a 7 minute mile. I am, however, a personal trainer and have strength trained 3-4x/week for 10+ years and have a general fitness background.

# Training

My first race was NYC Runs Big Apple Central Park Half in December 2023. I trained informally for 8-10 weeks leading up to it with a mix of easy and moderate runs, no speed work and my longest run of the build was 10 miles. I wanted to finish sub 2 but secretly get as close to 1:45 as possible. I finished in 1:44:58 and was hooked. 

I signed up for the NYC Runs Brooklyn Half for the following spring and committed to following a proper program - which would mean a lot of early mornings. My days often start with clients at 6/6:30am so that means out the door and running by 5am latest. With that came both the fighting off of endless excuses of why I shouldn't get out of bed and the inescapable self righteousness I felt once I did. I used Ben Parkes’ Level 3 Half Marathon Program which is designed for people wanting to run 1:35 - 1:40. It consisted of one speed workout and one long run/week with some HMP effort miles - all other milage was easy + strides. I peaked at 32 mpw and my longest run was 13 miles. I hit every speed workout and by the end was exceeding my pace goals. My goal was sub 1:38 but again to get as close to 1:35 as possible. I finished in 1:35:02. 

As seems like the natural trajectory for those of us engaged in the endless pursuit of proving themselves worthy, my running goals were now oriented around a BQ. I wasn’t ready to commit to a full yet so a sub 1:25 half felt like the next step. Another 10 minute PR , however, seemed like a fools errand - even with beginner gains on my side. I decided I would be happy with sub 1:28 but as close to 1:25 as I could muster. Step one, find a flat course (easier said than done in NYC). Thankfully I read about the Queens Marathon in this community and saw they had a half as well. Done.

I purchased Parkes’ Level 4 Program. It assigns 5k and 10k pace prescriptions based on goal HM time. With the goal of sub 1:25 my 5k paces were 5:55 - 6:05, my 10k 6:10-6:20 and HMP 6:25 - 6:35. As the program kicked off I was not hitting those paces. Every speed workout and long run with HMP was all but a disaster. I remembered feeling this way at the start of the last program and decided to keep shooting for the stars (sub 1:25) and at worst land on the moon (sub 1:28). 

Around week 8 of the cycle things started to click. I logged consecutive 40+ mile weeks. I was often exceeding the prescribed paces for my speed workouts and my final long run was 13 miles, 5 of which were at HMP (I averaged 6:29 for those 5). Holy shit I might actually do this…

It's worth noting I rarely met the prescribed weekly milage. I ran 5-6 days/week but the milage peaks at 54, with many in the high 40's and low 50's, and given my schedule personally and professionally, I wasn't able to. I did complete every speed workout as prescribed just reduced easy weekly milage and often shortened the long run.

The program prescribed a 2 week taper and the timing could not have been better. I have 2 kids - both were sick as dogs and not sleeping well. In hindsight I may have tapered tooooo much as a result. I still got my speed and moderate run in but milage dropped from 42 to 28 and then just 2 runs amounting to 10 miles total week of race.

# Pre-race

I wasn't nervous. And that made me nervous. With how busy work had been and sick kids I hadn't spent much time thinking about the race and then it was here. I followed Jonah Rosner (IG: rosnerperformance) advice and did a one day carb load, approx 600 grams. I tried to stick to whole food sources while minimizing fiber to ease digestion but still woke up race day feeling a bit heavy. I had some LMNT electrolytes, a banana and a PB&J. The Queens Half/Full Marathon/10k takes places in Flushing Wood Meadow Park and they use the Queen's Museum in the park as their HQ - which meant indoor bathroom access pre-race. First-fucking-class. Was able to use an indoor bathroom 2x pre race. This is luxury folks.

# Race

Miles 1-5

The fastest available pacers were 6:50 so I position myself in front of them. There were only about 20 of us there. People around me look fast. They had cool arm sleeves and thin gold necklaces on. Still, no nerves. Not good. Where's my adrenaline? 5 minutes before the start I took a Caffeinated BPN Go Gel. National Anthem. Countdown. And we're off.

30 seconds in and my first thought, ""This is not going to go well. I feel flat."" I had journaled that morning (don't judge) of what would make me proud about this race other than a good time and the answer was my effort. If I gave my best effort I'd be happy. I accepted that's what this race would be about.

This feels hard. I look down at my watch. 6:07. God damnit. I slow down to 6:30 pace and am passed by what feels like 15 people. Not my best start.

I had set my Garmin to do my own splits (or so I thought). I see the Mile 1 marker, hand to watch, 3...2...1... the mile registers automatically but I'm flustered and I also press the lap button. ""Lap 2, 1 second."" Jesus take the wheel. Now every mile will be read as 1 mile ahead of where I'm actually at via Airpods. An absolute mind fuck I'll have to deal with 12 more times.

Shortly after I settle in with a group of 3 who seem to be holding a 6:28-6:30 pace. Other than how I feel, it's perfect. Pre-race I commit to not looking at my heart rate. I do it anyways. 192. I laugh out loud. Well, let's see what happens.

There is some jostling around but for the most part still with the same crew through mile 6.

Mile 6-10

The 4th of the group dropped off around mile 5 so it's just the 3 of us now. The 2 guys leading the pack seem to know each other. They exchange a couple words and take off. I still felt like shit but Mile 5 was the first time I didn't hate this experience and I chalked it up to being in a group - a group that just left me.

I ran the next half mile with them still in my sights and they didn't seem to be getting further away. Hmm. Should I try to rejoin? I don't know enough about racing. Was this just a move I was supposed to cover? Was I practicing bad ettiequte by tailing them and they wanted to be rid of me? Fuck it let's go for broke. I chased them down and tucked back in with them. I decided that maybe tailing was bad form so I lead for a bit as well. This gave me a brief high and miles 7-8 were the best I felt all race.

At mile 10 one guy took off and neither I or the other guy tried to keep up.

Mile 11-13.1

I couldn't believe I was still holding pace and was waiting to experience some kind of bonk. I had been fighting a stitch since mile 5 but jabbing my fingers into it every 5 or so minutes seemed to be keeping it at bay. Then came the bridge (the only real incline of this course) and my running buddy took off. I tried to keep up but didn't have it. The downhill of the bridge was what solidified the stitch.

Mile 12 came shortly after the bridge (Lap 13 according to my Garmin connected AirPods - Lord). The stitch was growing with intensity. Pace slowed to 6:46. If the whole race was a test, Mile 13 was... something worse. There are some pretty comical pictures of me holding my side and grimacing as I tried to hold pace. Even so, it slowed to 7:02. I was passed by one person in that final mile. Bastard. No, good on him.

Saw the camera at the finish line. Tried to raise my arms in acknowledgment and show of victory but they only made it to the height of my head and pictures reveal it looked more like a cry for help - which is fitting.

# Post-race

Within minutes of crossing the line I receive a text of my time and telling me I finished 8th place overall and 2nd in my age group. Woah. I didn't expect that. It's a small race, sure, but still that felt good.

Overall I couldn't believe I was able to meet my B goal given how I felt and the mental battle I took on. Incredibly satisfying but am hoping to never have that experience again. in hindsight it may have been too much of a taper for me, at least mentally - but who knows. Going to keep attacking the half marathons and see how low I can get them. Sub 1:20 would be really amazing but I know that's at least a few races away as I've probably eaten up most of my beginner gains.

This community has been so fun to follow and I really looked forward to doing this write up. Thanks for all the inspiration, team.

And oh! I would love to have more of a community on strava so if you'd be so kind drop me a follow I'd happily do the same!"

**Training**

Started training 18 weeks ago using the Hal Higdon novice one training plan. I ran casually around 3-5 miles for 3 months prior but nothing serious. In my training 3 of the 4 runs a week I would run in my neighborhood on the streets and then I would complete a long run over the weekend at a hilly park. My peak mileage was 18 miles, I wasn't able to do the peak of the program plan (20) due to injury. Training went very smoothly until the end of week 14 when I suffered an ankle injury. Took me out for about 2 weeks and I slowly started running again week 16 with very low mileage. Thankfully recovery was quick with the help of PT, podiatrist, and trying as hard as possible to stay off my foot. My longest long run before marathon post ankle injury was 10 miles. I did a nice and slow shakeout 5k the morning before Training through the (LA) winter wasn't so bad - I just hated waking up early for long runs though. But it was nice to get them out of the way to enjoy my day. 



**Pre-Race**

I ran low mileage (2-3 miles) the week of the race. In the week I ate Korean barbecue and pasta, and the night before I had a pizza with some garlic knots to load up on carbs. I tried hard to stay hydrated, avoided alcohol, and got lots of sleep the week leading up. I probably only got about 6 hours the night of the race but I think it was fine. I packed 5 GUs with me (only ate 4) my airpods, my Garmin Vivoactive 3 watch, and some chapstick in my lululemon belt. 

**Race Day**

I woke up at 3:30 to be picked up at 4:30 and driven to Dodger Stadium. No issues getting in and got into the stadium around 5:15. Walked over by the Alo stretching area and waited about 20 minutes for the porta potties. Not amazing but not the worst! By 6am I met up with my running club to warm up and by 6:30 I was in the open corral crowd. We crossed the start line at 7:10. I did stop to use the first porta potties available at like .25 miles in LOL because I felt I had to go but I wasn't able to complete the job if you know what I mean. I tried to get out as quickly as I could and got back to it. I knew the course started off going downhill and wanted to be sure I didn't go out too fast. I kept my pace super slow and easy and just enjoyed the vibes. First 5k was the easiest 5k of my life! I was having so much fun. I was also expecting a very hilly first couple of miles in downtown LA and thankfully they werent too bad! My long runs always included some very steep hills so the hills here felt like a breeze. I ate half a chili cheese dog at mile 5. I stopped to say hi to friends twice, once at 6.5 and another time at 6.8. Both times I stopped to drink water, chat quickly, eat some oranges, take a picture etc. I stopped another time to use the porta potty again at around 10.8. The porta potty was so disgusting I wanted to get out of there as quick as possible. I continued on and felt really good through mile 13. My pace felt manageable but I really wanted to be sure that I had enough energy for the last half of the race. I will say I expended a lot of energy weaving through people! Sometimes people would just full on stop running right in front of me! It was super stressful. I started to notice pain in my right foot at around mile 15 but nothing too serious, definitely just felt like pain from pounding on my foot for so long and so hard on all the downhills. I stopped another time at 16.3 to say hi to my family and hug everyone. I was super excited to see them and wanted to stay and chat longer but they really wanted me to finish fast so I got a move on. Miles 18-20 were sooo much fun! Definitely the most crowded part of the race the spectators are all around you cheering and the energy is so high. It definitely makes it easier to run through this section of the course because of the out and back it can be really mentally taxing seeing the finish line on your left knowing it's still 8 miles away. It wasn't until mile 20 that I reaaalllllyyy started feeling the pain. I wouldnt say I hit the wall thankfully but I just started feeling the soreness in my quads, my glutes, my lower back, and my right foot was definitely taking a beating. I knew I just had to push through and keep running. The out and back is brutal at miles 20-23. It seriously feels like it'll never end and when you do finally get to the point where you turn around you still have over a 5k left and it's all uphill from there. Thankfully I had some friends right at that turn around point so they gave me some juice and motivation and I was off to finish the thing. My headphones died so I was finishing with no music, just cheers and talking to myself trying to motivate myself to keep pushing. I felt I had energy to pick up the pace so I pushed it for those last 3 miles. The last mile was the longest mile I have ever run in my entire life. It felt never ending! And it being uphill too is definitely not easy. You really really have to tap into your mental strength over your physical strength to get through that. When the finish line was in sight I gritted my teeth and finished strong. 4:35:49 was my official time and I am seriously so happy with it. 



**Post Race**

I am so effing sore. Seriously. Immediately after the race was over I felt shaky and my legs hurt like hell. My right foot has some throbbing pain and I'm actually kinda worried I injured it. I got my medal, took some pictures, walked to meet my family at the beer garden, and went to lunch. I was seriously hobbling everywhere lol. I spent the day after the race recovering with a hot tub so I am feeling better today but definitely still moving slowly. Probably wont run for another week or two. 



**Next Race**

I definitely feel like if I did it again I could do better. I stopped a lot and that definitely ate into my time - you can see my strava pace was a full 30 seconds quicker than my race pace because I was stopping my watch each time I stopped. I also feel like with more training I could keep a 9:30 pace more easily and for longer. I didn't do any speed sessions or anything like that in my training because I wasn't really concerned with time, but now I'm feeling competitive lol. I would love to go sub 4 one day. I also didn't do any cross training or weight training. I would like to incorporate that into my training next time to strengthen my ankles and improve my form. 



If you made it this far, thanks for reading! It was a really incredible experience and I am very happy with my performance. It was HARD but worth it. Training has helped me overcome some personal issues and reconnect with myself - the marathon was really just an opportunity to showcase that. I would love to answer any questions if you have any about my performance or about the race itself if you're considering signing up for next year!

### Training
I recently got a bug to start running some shorter distance races after dropping a dissapointing yet not totally awful (first time) 3:38 at Chicago this past October. I am covinced that some strong performances in shorter events will help drive me to sub 3:20 in addition to just racking up miles.To provide further context, I have been running anywhere from 30-45mpw since Chicago for funsies.

I derived most of my workouts from a combination of Pfitz marathon plans and split the phases of training into two week incriments. My 'build' was weeks 1-2: week 1 had 33 miles, and week 2 ramped up to mid 40s. I peaked with weeks 3-4 both cresting 50mpw,and then tapered during weeks 5-6 with 32,33 mpw, respectively, with the final week milage including the 10K. 

A majority of my workouts were easy 7-10 mile runs (7:45-8:30/mi) with a speed workout, long run, and a 4-5 mile recovery run mixed in throughout the week. To Monday Morning Quarterback myself a little bit (pun intended), I probably should have done a Vo2 workout (6:02-6:25/mi) in addition to a tempo workout (6:51-7:38/mi) or threshold workout (6:25-6:51/mi) during the week instead of doing just one, but am curious what the quality of my workouts would have been, especially on the high mileage weeks of a short training block. I guess another adujstment could have been lower mileage overall but higher difficulty of workouts...

Early on in the race week, I ran a 7mi dress rehersal with 2 @10K and managed to wreck my heel on a pair of Hyperion Max 2's that should have been retired. Theragunned the shit out of my right leg as the pain had permiated up to my hamstring in the form of cramps but felt really strong coming into race day. 

### Pre-Race
Wasn't able to have my traditional bagle with PB or Double shot of espresso because i had run out of coffee pods and pulled out a moldy sleeve of bagels from my cabinet. Oh well, settled for a regular cup of coffee and a cliff bar. Drove down, did a 1-mile warm up with some striders to the start line, found my co-workers and chatted with them until the anthem. 

### Race
I am a humble guy, when the announcer says, ""Fast runners to the front"", I try not to dash up to the start. However I do forget that 'fast-runner' is a very vague term so I paid for my humility by ducking and weaving for the first 400m. I figured that cost me a bit of energy but still cruised to my goal pace for the first mile. Unfortunately the course was not flat so it was definitely a challenge but made sure to take advantage of my leg length to catch my breath on the downhills. Everything went to plan except for a lady at the *second to last hill* saying, ""Good Job! Last hill!"" Well that lady was a bonafide liar because not 1/4 mile later I was running up a 270 degree hairpin turn into the final stretch with all of my oxygen dumped out on the 2nd to last hill. Ended up finding the last bit of energy to 'sprint' in for a decently respectable 41:20 finish. A minute short of my 'A' goal time but honestly had a blast. Any input on how everyone else designs their workouts leading up to a 10k would be much appreciated but I think I just need to get the Pfitz short distance book at this point. Also, I have not written this much since I graduated college so please forgive any grammatical, spelling, or stylistic errors in my writting. 

Cheers!

**TRAINING**

Have never been athletic. I've never been athletic. When I turned 39 in May 2024, I took my health seriously in an effort to be ""healthy"" by the time I turned 40. After dropping 30lb (down from 266lb), I started exercising. I started ""running"" via couch25k August 2024. I got my first runner's high in October 2024, and got the bright idea to sign up for a marathon. Fast forward to January, I'd built up to 30-35mi weeks for roughly a month prior, and began Pfitz 18/55 January 13, 2025. I worked Pfitz via heart rate reserve % using the cliche formula, rather than a real max heart rate test. Up until week 13, I worked all my paces off heart rate, and let them be what they were, without an actual ""goal"" pace. I started noticing that based on heart rate, I SHOULD have been able to do sub-4. I switched to pacing based on a 3:59:59 from there until the end, which wasn't much different, heart rate wise, from what I had worked up to. All of my runs, up until taper time, went well. I did notice that my paces, based on heart rate, for speed work and LT, were a crunched together a lot more than my ""MP"" and ""MLR/LR"" pacing. The 18/14mp run went extremely well based on my goal. The 20's went well too. Once I got to taper period, everything seemed to get hard, but I just attributed it to cumultive fatigue. It may very well have been, but the weather also got substantially warmer and more humid. The original course had about 850-900ft of elevation change, 90% of that occured on three separate hills, with the rest being along the river road, built over an old railroad grade along the river (FLAT). Due to damages on the road from Hurricane Helene in 2024, that haven't been repaired, the course was changed last minute, to double the elevation, and do the hills 2x.

**PRERACE**

I got an AirBnB about 20min from the start/finish. The evening prior to the marathon, I did the associated 5k for a shakeout run. Admittedly, I did it a smidge too fast for a shakeout. I didn't race it, but I did put a little more into it than I should have, but I don't think it hurt me in the grand scheme of things. My girlfriend, daughter, and parents were with me. Afterwards we went to dinner, which took a lot longer than I wanted. I ended up not getting to bed until about 10:30pm, which was an hour and a half later than I wanted. Race day, I woke up to thunder/lightning, high winds, and torrential rains. All of which were anticipated. I had a little bit of coffee, half a bagel, and a cup of orange juice. The rain lasted until right up until start time. No pre race jitters, surpringly.

**RACE**

Weather was 62-68F and HUMID. I knew better, but set out with a 9:07/mi average in mind. If you don't know North Carolina in May, it gets humid, very humid. I knew this, but I sent it anyway. I knew that most of my training was done in IDEAL conditions, and the elevation of the course had doubled (1720ft), I should've shaved 40sec or so off my pace, but I didn't. At roughly mile 10, I wasn't hurting, but I knew that I couldn't hold that pace for the race. The wheels fell off around mile 15, and I was walking up the hills. I started entering a mindset of self-pity, bruised ego, and anger. I was doing Maurten 100 gels every 45min, and 500ml (62g carb) from Tailwind, every hour, shooting for 85g+/- carbs each hour. Around 3hr in, Tailwind was hard to get down, as were gels, so I started grabbing gatorade from aid stations around mile 19. The largest climb of the race (mile 12& 23/24) was 245ft over 0.80mi. I walked it, and tried jogging the back side by my quads were shot, and I just couldn't keep my legs turning over. Once it got flat again, I was able to hold 10:30ish/mi and at least give the appearance of finishing ""strong"" for the finish line video haha.

**POST RACE**

*I questioned why I did it. I was extremely dissapointed in my time, and the mistakes I made, despite knowing better. I was rewarded with love, support, and pride from my daughter, girlfriend, and parents. They reminded me that no matter what, they were still proud of me and how I went from couch to marathon in less than a year. I was able to down a few slices of orange at the finish line, but couldn't get liquids down at all, for at least 45min. Finally was able to stomach some LMNT I had in the car. I managed to down some chocolate milk once we got back to the Air BnB. After a short nap, I woke up around 3:30pm hungry and ready for real food. The next day, I was jonsing for another run after questioning why I even ran in the first place 24hr before. I WILL do another marathon, not sure what yet, but as it stands now, I'm signed up for Blackbeards Revenge 100mi in March 2026, and will work backwards from there, to fill in the gaps and train accordingly.

### Training
 I signed up for this marathon back in June, two months after setting a personal best in the Brooklyn Half (1:27:30). I’d always wanted to run a full marathon, but honestly, the idea was incredibly nerve-wracking. I knew how tough that half marathon felt—I couldn’t even imagine doubling the distance. 

To prepare, I also signed up for the Jersey City Half as an early tune-up to gauge my fitness. For the BK Half, I used the Pfitz 12/55 plan but had to shorten it to 10/55 after getting injured early in the cycle. This time, I wanted to up my game. I committed to the 12/70 plan for the full marathon. I considered the 18/70 plan but decided against it because I needed to build my mileage gradually. I was at about 40 MPW in early August and needed time to hit 50+ comfortably. I entered the plan feeling healthy-ish. My Achilles was always a little sore in the mornings—something I’ve come to think of as a summer thing since it usually goes away in winter. The first few weeks of the plan in September felt manageable. 

I bumped my mileage to around 65+ and ran the Jersey City Half, shaving 20 seconds off my PR with a 1:27:30. I was happy with the result but had been aiming for 1:25. I’d heard that 1:25 was the benchmark for a sub-3 marathon, which became my ultimate goal for my first marathon. Going sub-3 felt like more than just an achievement—it was a way to signal to myself that I was on the right path with running. I like setting lofty goals: shoot for the moon, land on the stars. Even if I blew up and ran a 3:07, I would’ve been fine with that as long as I gave sub-3 a shot. It sounds ridiculous, but that’s the mindset I had. To complement the Pfitz plan, I lifted three times a week—Monday for core and Wednesday/Friday for heavy compound lifts focused on running (hex bar deadlifts, single-leg RDLs, lunges, etc.). 

I skipped only one recovery session. My mileage peaked at 75 MPW in late October and stayed above 70 for about four weeks. I added extra miles where I could and followed the Pfitz plan almost exactly, only skipping a recovery run now and then. The taper felt unnecessarily long—honestly, it was—but I went into race day feeling nervous yet optimistic. I’d done a ton of Googling, and most calculators based on my half-marathon times suggested 3:05 was my ceiling. But I knew I could do sub-3.


### Pre race

I woke up at 4:30 a.m., did my warm-up, made a much-needed movement, and then ate some oatmeal and a banana before heading to the race. My brother and sister-in-law were huge helps the entire weekend, shepherding me from place to place and even following along the route. It was lovely having them there.  I got to my corral (B) hoping to find a 3:05 pacer. The plan was to stick with them until around mile 18 and then make my move. But there was only a 3:10 pacer and a 3:00 pacer. I talked to both to get a sense of their plans. Pacers are half therapists, half pacers—ha. Both were aiming for even splits, which sounded good to me.  I decided to just go for it, trust myself, and stick with the 3:00 pacer. If I blew up, at least I’d know I gave it everything. I avoided jumping around too much to conserve energy. For fueling, I brought six Maurten 100 gels. No caffeine—I don’t usually do caffeine, and I didn’t want to risk it spiking my BPM artificially.  The horn fired, and we were off.


### The Race
For the first few miles, I worried I’d gone out too hot. I’d read so many race reports about people blowing up after a fast start, and with my half-marathon fitness earlier this year, I kept glancing at my watch and BPM, convinced I might have messed up. Seeing my brother and sister-in-law at mile 2 got me emotional—I teared up a little. But my BPM kept creeping into the 170s, and I felt like I needed to calm down. I was pressed that I’d overcooked it. Then I hit mile 5, running through the city center (I think), and there were these massive speakers blasting Future’s “BRAZZIER.” I know, it sounds ridiculous, but I didn’t hear much hip-hop from the crowd along the route, and that bassline was unmistakable. At this point, I decided to just LOCK IN. I switched my watch display to show just distance, time, and lap pace and told myself, “You’re going to sub-3 your first marathon.” I repeated it like a mantra.

 
Catching up to the 3:00 pacers, I kept them in sight, trailing about 10 seconds behind. Miles 8 to 13 took us out of the city, and things got quieter. Running with the 3:00 pacers was special, though—you’d hear the crowd yelling, “YOU’RE GOING TO BREAK 3!!” Every time, I thought, “Yes, I am.” I had a few close calls at water stations—some people were polite, others a little less so—but I hadn’t run in a pack like this before, so adjusting was tricky. At one point, I drifted from the pack and tucked in behind taller runners to draft and conserve energy. As a motor racing fan, it was pretty cool to do this in real life. I crossed the halfway point at 1:30:12 and reminded myself again, “You’re going to sub-3 your first marathon.” 

I made friends along the way and was recording selfie videos to capture my lap pace. Clown me if you want, but I wanted to capture my first marathon in a cool way. Maybe I lost a minute doing this, but I didn’t care. Miles 13 to 18, where I expected things to start getting tough, went smoother than I anticipated. I trusted my training and focused on conserving energy on the downhills, letting momentum carry me. Around mile 18, I met another runner who asked me my goal. “Sub-3,” I told him. He nodded and said, “Okay, bro, we’re both going sub-3 today.” We locked in together. 

Running up Main Street to the turnaround was wild. The energy from the crowd was insane. I didn’t cheer back—trying to conserve every bit of energy—but Philly, y’all showed up for me, and I felt it. I caught up to the pacer around this time and asked if we were on track. He said we were early, but his plan was to finish at exactly 3:00. I felt ready and decided to make my move around mile 23 with my new running buddy from mile 18. Miles 23 to 26.2 were a blur. The wall didn’t hit me until mile 25, and even then, it was more mental than physical. I told myself, “You’re going to sub-3 your first marathon. Lock in.” And I did. The finish line came into view, and I gave it everything I had. As soon as I crossed, I stopped my watch and collapsed to the ground. My time? 2:58:12.


### Post Race
Honestly, I’m still floored. As I sit here writing this, my thighs are on fire, and walking down stairs two days later feels like an extreme sport. Insane.  That said, I’m planning to follow the Pfitz recovery plan and gradually build back to 50+ miles per week by January 2025, aiming to hit 60 comfortably after that. My next big goal is the United Half in March, where I’m shooting for a 1:25 or better. Fingers crossed—I’ll see how it goes!  Also, I can’t thank the pacers enough. Without them, I’m sure I would’ve overcooked it. Locking into their pace was a game changer, keeping me steady and focused when I might’ve otherwise burned out. Truly, they made all the difference.

**Background:** I Started running in 2017 and jumped almost immediately to trail running and ultra distance races. In 2020 I started doing consistent mileage, and the past 4 years I've averaged right around 2,300 miles per year. Was getting beat up and feeling slow from focusing on 100 mile races, so decided 2024 would be a focus on ""speed"", which started with a trail marathon, then transitioned to road and XC races. In July 2024 I ran a 5:38 mile, which gave me confidence I could try and crack 40 for the 10k (based on VDOT), which I did in September in an XC race, this had always seemed like a good but unattainable goal. Based on that 10k, I jumped in a 25k race where finished with what would become my marathon GP. One final half marathon time trial (current PR) convinced me I was close enough to try and crack 3, which would be right around a BQ for me. Mesa lined up well with timing and looked like good weather and a fast course.

**Training Pfitz:**

Technically I did a modified Pfitz 12/70, but my training in the six weeks prior lined up very closely to the 18/70 plan, and I ended up be almost exactly on the Pfitz plan. I had one week that was significantly higher and one down week that was significantly lower in mileage. I added more MP than Pfitz prescribes, doing MP every other LR, with my biggest workout being 22 miles with 15 at MP roughly 6 weeks out. I did one 5k race early in the block and then two 10k time trials, first was 38:2X (solo) and second 36:21 (paced).

The 2nd 10k put me with a 2:47:xx predicted time, which seemed insane, so I asked on this sub, and was given the wise advice to stick to what I'd trained for. This was definitely the right call since BQ was really my only goal, and I am convinced I'd need a lot higher mileage to hit that time.

Thoughts on Pfitz: This plan got me in the best shape of my life where I ran a 10k that I would have never thought possible even right before the run. It was tough, but always felt the down weeks gave me enough recovery. I did run my easy/recovery runs much slower than prescribed by Pfitz or VDOT, usually 9:30-10min pace or so. I also switched most vo2max workouts into threshold workouts. Would certainly recommend for those that already have a good base.

**Nutrition:**

\- 1 Precision gel w/ Caffeine 5min prior to start

\- 2 handheld bottles for the first roughly 2 hours. Skratch High Carb mixed to about 80g carb + 50mg caffeine + additional electrolytes via Saltstick capsules (half capsule per bottle).

\- 1 Precision gel w/ Caffeine at half

\- 1 Precision gel at 17

\- After mile 17, grabbing Gatorade Endurance from every aid station (missed one) and occasional additional water. I also managed to grab one water bottle from a spectator aid station.

\- 1 Precision gel w/ Caffeine at 20

\- 1 Precision gel at 23

Totals: 310g carb + whatever I got from the Gatorade Endurance, maybe an addition 20-30. 400mg of caffeine. 1000ml of liquids + whatever I grabbed at aid stations, maybe an additional 200ml. Unknown on sodium, but a lot.

**Shoes:**

Adios Pro 4: These things are fast, and what I wore for my 10k PR. I am a midfoot to slight forefoot striker, with moderate overpronation. Overall quite happy, but certainly some less than ideal things.

\- Toes got fucked. I sized up 1/2 size over my AP3's but still got the blood stained toe box. I didn't notice myself sliding at all, so it's curious how this happened. At mile 20ish I was rounding a 90 degree corner and got a shooting electric pain from toes that enveloped my whole foot, causing a drastic limp for a few 100 meters. Eventually I couldn't feel it anymore, but that's where the blood stain ended up being.

\- Didn't have any ankle issues, but looking at some photos, I was overpronating more than I'd every seen before. Probably not ideal.

\- My quads were tired very early on, which also happened in my 20 mile LR where I wore these. Maybe something to do with how soft they, or maybe just coincidence. Post race my quads, knees, and legs overall are fine, so I guess they did a good job of protecting my legs.

**Pre-Race:**

I'd been doing a mini-carb load for all of my key long runs, but this was the first time to go all in and it was quite unpleasant. I felt bloated and heavy, but was still able to get 550g per day for 3 days. Morning of, I ate my normal breakfast 3:30 hours before race start, and we headed to the bus shuttle. This whole time until I had to drop off my drop bag, I was sipping on Skratch high carb with added electrolytes (saltlick).

This was my first marathon and first race with thousands of participants (\~3,200), so the whole logistics part was a bit overwhelming. You were able to bring a drop bag to the start which was nice, and allowed me to use my massage gun and theraband to help with warm up without having to run. Porta-potties were a nightmare but I assume this is normal. Made it to the start line with about 4 min to go.

**Race:**

Plan: Lined up with the 3 hour pacer and planned to stick there until the last \~10k and put down whatever was left in the tank.

* **Miles 1–4:** The race started in the dark and was a bit sketchy with big crowds of erratic runners and unseeable obstacles in the road. I kept pretty tight to the pacer for the first couple of miles, but he kept fading slower, and the hill was just too aggressive to not run quicker than overall goal pace. That was the last I saw of the pacer and heard reports that he blew up anyway. Temps were cool, though warmer than I'd hoped (low 50's to start). Effort was extremely easy, like long run easy pace easy. I could have had a full blown conversation. My HR was in the 140's (max 194). As the sun came up, it turned this section into what would be by far the most scenic part of the course.
* **Miles 5–6:** This is the lone significant climb on the course and lasts for a little over 1.5 miles, something like just over 100ft a mile. I am a pretty weak climber, and also wanting to keep my HR under 160, I took it very conservatively falling almost 30sec behind pace on the first mile. People were pushing hard on this climb, and I was getting passed left and right. A lot of runners were breathing like it was a 10k.
* **Miles 7–12:** At this point I'm starting to get nervous, while the effort is still very easy, my legs, particularly quads are already feeling tired. Assumed I'd be riding cloud 9 at this point. It wasn't work yet, but it wasn't ""easy"" despite the effort level. Locked in to a couple of couple of guys and mostly just tracked with them and just focused on holding the pace.
* **Miles 13–20:** Halfway, great! Is it OK for it to start being work now? Damn, it's getting hot. I think they said it's supposed to be easy until mile 20, uh oh, am I in trouble? I fell off pace with the guys I was running with for several miles. I had to pee badly, but knew I didn't have much cushion if I was going to fade which seemed inevitable. So I did it, I let it out! Felt much better and start reeling the guys in, and by mile 19 I moved past them as they started to fade. Confidence was building, but I was still wary of the impending wall, when would it hit? Continued to hold a conservative pace.
* **Miles 21–23:** I think I'm kind of riding a high at this point, I'm moving up in the field and I made it to 20! Then I remember, I still have my music!! Cranked up the Shokz and let vibe boost pick up my pace. Now I'm passing so many people, while also dodging the 10k walkers and back of pack half marathoners, taking all my focus just to find the best line. At one point I tucked in behind a guy who went flying past, before deciding it was still too early to send it, wasn't 100% my legs would hold out.
* **Miles 24–Finish:** I am now pushing, this feels like MP effort during my workouts. HR is in the mid 160's and climbing and breathing heavy, but I feel good, it feels appropriate. Let's send it this last mile! I'm digging hard, just focused on getting to that mile 26 marker before dropping the hammer. I see the sign coming...""Mile 25"", fuuuuuuuuuuuck. Somehow got my miles off. For a bit I was deflated and fell off pace, but quickly found the motivation to climb back in the pain cave. Emptied the tank with everything I had left the last 1/3 mile.

**Post Thoughts:**

Could I have gone faster? Probably, but no where near 2:47, maybe sub 2:55. Either way, I'm happy with the outcome and left it all out there the last few miles. Really happy I was able to negative split, and moved up something like 150 spots over the second half. Mesa was extremely well organized from the logistics to the course design and control. The second half of the course is kind of drag, but honestly I was so locked in at that point I'm not sure it made a difference. The weather was hot, which was unfortunate, but in the end it probably didn't change much with how I raced."

### Context
35M, been running off and on for eight years. With two kids and a busy job (often involving travel) it's never been a priority. Just the odd 10k and HM, mostly with friends, sometimes a year or two of barely running. 

To give context, 2021, 2022 and 2023 were all c.300 miles total running each year (youngest was born in 2021).

Mid 2023 I finally agreed to run a spring 24 marathon with two friends. I started training for that about 20 weeks out. Minimal structure, just tried to go Z2 mostly and used the weekly long run distance from a RW cookie cutter plan. 30-40mpw with a peak at 45ish. We ran a 3:54 together, I felt like I had more in me so I then did a 3:25 6 weeks later.

In typical fashion, I caught the bug. Trained 5k across summer (light mileage) then did a HM block averaging 30mpw. Ran a 1:29 half in October, which felt like everything came together on the day.

### Training
Thanks mostly to this sub I chose Pfitz 18/55. I was cautious as this was my first time stepping up to that mileage, plus the first week would have been Christmas - so I started early, did the first 2 weeks, then took Christmas off. Repeated week 2 after Christmas and continued as normal.

Overall the block went really well. Missed 2x LRs through illness but these were both in 'down' weeks. In total I only missed about 5 days across the 18 weeks. Had to switch up a couple of runs for indoor bike or treadmill due to snow & ice early on but feel like I hit the plan sufficiently. Couple of niggles here and there which I managed. 

Peaked at 57 miles and felt fit. During the block I hit PBs in the 10k (39:43), 5k (18:59) and HM (1:26:24) across tune-ups. 

In the fabled 18 with 14 at MP workout, I held 7:00/mile average. This was at lunchtime, having run 7 the previous evening after a 7 mile hike in the AM. I'd run the HM 5 days before that workout too. This gave me confidence that I could hold 7 flat on race day with a taper, shoes and adrenaline. I actually suspected this would be undercooking slightly but I wanted to hold back, hit 20-22 feeling strong and see if I could turn it up vs another struggle in the late stages.

### Pre-race

I followed the three week taper in the plan. It felt way too soft and I struggled with maranoia big time. As you'll see from how the race panned out, I'm going to experiment with a shorter taper next time. All a learning experience.

I finalised my goals at the start of the taper. 3:03:xx felt realistic, certainly sub 3:05 should be the A goal. Knew I didn't have sub-3 yet. In my head I became overly fixated on 3:03 being my new reality, lots of affirmations.

Carb loaded fine. Got there nice and early, used the toilets, mostly waited around. The start procedure is ridiculous and wants you in a pre-start funnel 45-55 minutes before your start time. There were no toilets in this section and nowhere to warm up, as each wave had about 1800 people crammed in. There was space to warm up before you enter the holding area but obviously you're fully cooled down by go time. People were peeing in bushes (central reservation of a dual carriageway) which isn't good. IMO this is just a disastrous setup and was easily the worst aspect of the race.

The weather forecast beforehand suggested a starting temperature of 12 C / 53F, rising to 16C/60F by noon. I'd be finishing around 12:30. Slightly warm but felt manageable.

In reality it turned out to be 14C/57F at 9am, hitting 20C/68F by 1pm. There was zero cloud cover and the sun got really brutal, real quick. As you'll see...

### Race
I'd planned to go out steady. There was a slight downhill from the start which meant I was going too fast for the opening half a mile until I checked my watch. 

I spent the first 10 miles or so consciously holding myself back. Felt really solid and like my 'natural' pace would be around 6:50ish. Obviously this is always a lie in the marathon. What I didn't do is dial it back due to the sun. I just stuck to my plan.

Took on water at every aid station and sipped from my flask (homemade Maurten 320 - thanks u/nameisjoey ). Sipped a gel intermittently. In hindsight I didn't drink enough in the first hour and should have had a rigid gel plan. Pouring water on my head helped but I now know I was rapidly dehydrating. The saltstick chews were ok but tickled my throat and I dialled those back as well. Bad idea.

10-16 were slightly less comfortable, starting to feel it but still well within myself. Had one of those bizarre phantom niggles in my left foot at some point which lasted a couple of miles. Mostly just guarding against complacency in this section.

The crowds were great, especially in Sale & Altrincham (10-14). Shoutout to all the people spraying grateful runners with garden hoses or water pistols.

16-18 I started to feel the tide perhaps turning. Quite a lot of people were already walking at this point. Aerobically I felt untroubled but my legs were starting to feel a little heavy. Tiredness was kicking in. I maintained my 'run the mile you're in' focus and ploughed on, sipping my gel mix more frequently. I'd popped 100mg of caffeine at the 2 hour point so was hoping this would carry me through.

Not long after the 18 marker I felt my right foot start to cramp. Then my left hammy. From this point on I was on the verge of major cramps throughout both legs. I slowed slightly to a manageable pace to stave off the cramps. Every time I tried to push the pace back up, something cramped.

I can only describe these final 8 miles as a sufferfest. My pace continued to decline based entirely on what I could manage without cramping. For the first time I was genuinely considering a DNF. Like, for a solid half an hour. I really, really wanted to quit but somehow didn't. I accepted quite quickly that my A goal was out of reach but became increasingly concerned that I wouldn't even go sub 3:10. Lots of mentally beating myself up here.

Anyone running yesterday will attest to the final 6 miles being a warzone. Somehow by shuffling along I was passing tons of people walking. Multiple people were getting medical attention, passed out with heatstroke. Lots of stretching out cramps or hobbling. I only walked through the final two water stations, determined to keep shuffling otherwise. The water at 25 really did give me a final boost to squeeze the pace up slightly after miles of steady decline. 

My mantra late in races is 'Gattaca'. i.e. - don't save anything for the swim back (IYKYK). Somehow I hit mile 26 and the finishing straight came into view. I pushed as hard as I could without completely seizing up and somehow closed in my original target pace of 6:55. The finishing line video shows me immediately doubling over and grimacing horribly! I made it under 3:10, just. Mission accomplished.

### Post-race
Struggled through the finish funnel, draining the water. By this point I had recognised how horribly dehydrated I was (I ended up not going to the toilet until 6pm so 9 hours without - despite taking on many litres of fluid in that time). I was hugely disappointed immediately that I had only managed a 3:09 and blown up so badly.

Collected my bag and checked my phone to see tons of messages of support. Wife told me the kids were watching the finish livestream and cheering wildly which had me on the verge of tears. Collected myself while sat down, chatted to a few people.

Turns out everyone I spoke to also had their goals cruelly crushed by the conditions. One guy was aiming for sub 3 and ended up on 3:22, which made me feel less bad about my own miss. I then reflected on the fact I had actually landed a 16 minute PB vs last year. Forced some food down myself, chatted to more people, and headed home to see the family.

Had a nice restaurant meal with the wider family in the evening, the kids had made me a banner which they put up behind the table. Again this really helped put it in perspective and stopped me beating myself up for leaving 5-6 minutes on the table vs my plan.

Overall I am truly proud of taking 16 mins off and for continuing to the finish without slowing too badly. I'm actually grateful for the experience.  I've learned a ton about myself and how to individualise training, nutrition and hydration next time out. I really need to train myself to take on more water while running. I also have a few specific tweaks I'll make to training. Including a shorter taper!

I'm sore today but mostly the lingering after effects of cramps. Plan for the rest of the year is Valencia half in October (1:24:xx goal), I'll do a mile & 5k block before then with an emphasis on strength training. Then it's time for the sub-3 tilt next Spring. No clue which race yet but I am open to suggestions of mid-sized races without the awful starting line delays!

**Training**

I took a 5 year hiatus from running and during that time, I developed an addiction to alcohol that culminated with outpatient detox in November of 2024. I was drinking a 5th of Vodka daily as a minimum (it always ends with Vodka...) from 2022 until my detox. Prior to 2022, a 5th would last me around two days.I don't wish withdrawals on anybody and I still take Gabapentin daily to stave off alcohol cravings. During the detox, I decided that this was a second shot at having a productive life outside of just drinking, working and wondering how quickly I could end a work meeting so I could go have a drink.

A few days after the withdrawal shakes went away and I finished my dose of Librium, I bought a Garmin Enduro 3, downloaded Strava, Carb Manager and started the work. I initially went out for runs at a pace of 11:54 min/mi. I utilized the run-walk method and quickly learned that it was going to take a lot to even finish a mile without feeling like I would have a panic attack and pass out.

I started utilizing Garmins Daily Suggested Workouts at the end of November for a duration of 14 weeks. I found that the Daily Suggested workouts of base building were extremely helpful as a (once again) beginner and in November I ran a total of 8.6 miles. December 2024 - 77.2 miles, January 2025 - 84 miles, February 2025 - 115.8 miles, March 2025 - 145.9 miles, April - 144.6 miles. 

In November after a week of sobriety, I had found out that my bloodwork was just trash. My total cholesterol was 211 mg/dL (range is 0-199) and my triglycerides were 261 mg/dL (range is 0-150). These are just two of the metrics amongst others that were not looking good. My blood pressure upon waking was routinely 180/100 during the first few weeks of being sober. My blood pressure while being an alcoholic was even higher than this, pushing 190/120 on multiple occasions with a resting heart rate of 80-90 bpm. There was a long period of time during my addiction where I avoided doctors, hospitals, or really anywhere medical where a professional would put 2 and 2 together and call me out. This avoidance brought on immense anxiety which only made me drink more. There were multiple days at a time during the span of my addiction where I chose alcohol over food, even though I had food readily available. Mind you, this whole time, I held down a corporate 9-5 and lived in Downtown Chicago (shoutout to Streeterville). By the end of December 2024, I was in a 1000 calorie deficit/per day and tracking all of my calories via Carb Manager. My meals were pretty simple, breakfast consisted of eggs and beef sausages, lunches were always 85/15 ground turkey and dinners were a combination of healthy nuts with 90/10 ground beef. I averaged 1800 calories per day during the December 2024 - end of April 2025 timeframe. I went from 215LB on November 175th to 163lb as of this post, today. I most recently had bloodwork taken in February and my total cholesterol dropped down to 170 mg/dL (range is 0-199) and my triglycerides have dropped to 145 mg/dL (range is 0-150). As one could imagine, not only was I dropping weight and having better bloodwork, but I was feeling amazing and could not believe how much damage my body took and how it was actually able to bounce back. Nothing fits anymore.

As you can tell by my mileages above, I *really* got into running as a healthy addition to my sobriety (along with having a psychiatrist and going to Alcoholics Anonymous twice a week). I had no idea if I’d ever race, but, in February a coworker had suggested that I sign up for the JP Morgan Chase Corporate Challenge 5K and I figured, why not? I had 10 weeks to get in a training block and I have coworkers that are extremely supportive and have run it every year. I started a 10 week training block with Garmin Coaching and I finally got in the speed-work that I had been avoiding during the first four months of returning to running. By the time I had started the 10 week training block, I was able to comfortably run up to 10 miles at a pace of 10:30 min/mi in Zone 2 with a HR range of 130-152 bpm. I was able to knock a few PR’s that I was really happy with at the end of this 10 week block, including a 5:55 min/mile and a 5K time of 27:20. I noticed that runs weren't necessarily easier but they felt easier. My pace would drop alongside my heartrate so I was getting faster and faster.

This block consisted of the following workouts per week;

Sunday (base): 1 mile WU, 5 mile base run, 1 mile CD  
Monday(threshold) : 1 mile WU, 20-40 min threshold, 1 mile CD  
Tuesday(rest): Active Rest Day (usually golfed a local 9 hole course or went to the driving range)  
Wednesday(V02 max): 1 mile WU, 10x 0.5 mile sprints at 177+ HR), 1 mile CD  
Thursday(base): 1 mile WU, 5 mile base run, 1 mile CD  
Friday(base): 1 mile WU, 8-10 mile base run, 1 mile CD  
Saturday(long run): 10-15 mile base run

I averaged around 35-40 miles per week with this training block and peaked at 47 miles. I cut out my calorie deficit in the last three weeks of the training block because I had already hit a weight that I was very happy with (170LB) and lesson learned, I was recovering much quicker due to eating maintenance calories. One week prior to my 5K, I PR’d my mile time and hit 5:55 min/mile. I was ecstatic and had never run this fast before, even during my teen years when I was a skinny 140 LB kiddo. I knew that I wouldn’t be able to keep up this pace in the 5K but I knew that I could probably pull off 7:45-8:00 min/miles as long as I tapered correctly and didn’t let the adrenaline consume me before the race. 

**Pre-race**

T-1 day. The anxiety is already setting in and my resting heart rate has gone from an average of 45bpm to 70bpm. During my last taper run, I tried imagining myself running with a crowd and I had a huge adrenaline dump and my HR went from 150bpm to 170bpm without increasing pace or effort. I knew that I had to accept the fact that no matter what happened during the race, I already came so FAR and if I decide to walk during the race, so be it.

Day of race. I drove into work (Downtown Chicago) because I really did not want to spend over an hour in the train going back to the suburbs when I know I could drive back home in about 30 minutes. Felt pretty anxious all day but still managed to keep my routine. Had an easy breakfast with coffee and then had a chicken salad for lunch. Luckily the race was at 6:50PM which is near the time I usually go for runs so I was able to not divert too much away from the usual day. The end of the work day was spent with colleagues stopping by to wish me luck and telling me how happy they were to see me get ready for my first race.

The race was at 6:50pm so at 5:00pm, I changed into my REI half tights, pinned my bib to the awesome t-shirt provided by my company (I remember thinking this can’t be happening right now), put on my Vaporfly 3’s and headed to my car to drop off my work clothes. Once I dropped everything off, I headed to Grant Park to find my companies tent. “It’s cold” I thought as I walked to Grant Park. “I can’t wait to run so I can just get warm already”. I walked leisurely to Grant Park (about a 15 minute walk from where I work) but my heart rate was already coasting around 130bpm and I knew I needed to just relax once I found the tent. Tent found, dropped off my stuff and chatted with some colleagues who have been lifetime runners. Excited, nervous, cold. I looked down at my green bib on my shirt and started making my way to the “green corral”. I was shocked at how many people there were. 

**Race**

Red corral just took off and I’m finding that my heart rate has dropped to around 80bpm right before we start. I tell myself “hey, it’s just another run. Remember to push it”. The horn sounds and we go. It takes about 5 seconds between the sound of the horn and for the people directly in front of me (couple hundred people probably) to start moving. I hit “start” on my watch and the timer begins. Holy shit people are running FAST. I am pushing it and I am being passed as if I were moving 3mph. I don’t know much but I know that I don’t want to cook myself in the first mile and then crash out. It IS a 3.5 mile race but I was really focused on my 5K time because I had a PR that I wanted to break. “it’s so cold” and variations of that thought are what I am thinking about during the first half mile. 

One mile, 7:07 pace. I quickly glance down at my watch and I am surpassing the splits I thought I would have. “Am I going too fast?”. 1.5 miles in and I seriously consider stopping. My lungs are burning, the transition from being cold and shivering to sweating and running feels really weird. A loud crowd of runners suddenly turned into laser sharp focus, nothing but footsteps, heavy breathing and the occasional sound of a crowd cheering us on. About 2 miles in, we go under a bridge and the temp goes from 45F to probably 60F. “Oh wow, that feels amazing”. I think about stopping again but I have too much momentum, quitting is absolutely not an option at this point unless I feel that I am going to be injured. 

2 miles, pace 7:37. “Okay, I’ve definitely slowed a bit but still doing good. I turn my music off because the sound of thousands of footsteps is so cool. This is not an every day thing and I don’t get to experience this during my solo training runs. During this mile, we’re passing on a portion of lower wacker drive and I can see the building I used live in during my time in Streeterville. I take a brief second to think about all of the physical falls I had in that apartment - from being absolutely wasted, to the daily dry-heaves before I left the apartment.

3 miles, pace 6:02: Not much thinking going on at this point of the race. Making sure I continue breathing and don’t trip over anyone. I pass up a lot of people and it. feels. good. “Half a mile. Half a mile. Half a mile. Half a mile left” is the only thought I had until I hit 3.1 miles and **PR’d from 21:47 to 21:25**. I’m ecstatic that I hit a PR, followed up with being mad that someone decided this race should be 3.**5** miles. 

3.5 miles; Official Time: 28:06.

**Post-race**

I cross the finish line, grab a water and head to the company tent. My faster colleagues were already grabbing a snack as I was walking into the tent. My buddy PR’d his 5K, with a time of 16:28. We celebrate and quickly start shivering due to being sweaty and the temp now having dropped even more as the sun went down. Cold is the keyword of the day. I feel nauseous and at one point I contemplate excusing myself to go see if I’ll throw up. Luckily, I didn’t throw up. As everyone is getting ready to leave and head to a bar that our company had rented out, I start the 15 minute walk back to my car to drive home.

A few lessons learned.

1. Moving forward, I will not be in a calorie deficit while in a training block. Recovery is slowed and injury risk rises. 
2. Racing has me hooked. 
3. I’m proud of myself for not leaving any gas in the tank (especially when it came to that last mile).
4. I need to pace myself better. I feel like running my 2nd mile at 7:37 and then running my last mile at 6:02 shows that I have improvement to make when it comes to pacing. I spent minimal time looking at my watch and tried my best to run by effort however it’s pretty clear that I cooked a bit too much in my first mile.

I just bought “Daniels Running Formula” and I’m hoping to start another 5K Training block in the next few days. Not 100% sure where I’ll go from here but I know I want to race again, and soon. 

Hopefully this was an interesting read for some of you. To those that have/are struggling with addiction, you are not alone. Life is so much better without drugs/alcohol. For every 1 “fun” alcohol story, I have 100 stories of struggling and not having a good time. I know that I am a much better person when I am sober, for myself and those around me.

I wake up every morning with the same mantra; I don’t know if I’ll be sober tomorrow, but I’ll do everything I can to stay sober today. 

Cheers.

**Background and training** 

I've been running since I was young, did athletics for 7 years as a child and after stopping at 13 years old I always continued to run, with some short breaks here and there. It was never really organized, as I just did it for fun, but I always made some modest miles which gave me a basis to train more efficient when I got really interested in my early 30s. I'm now 36, and the last years I've worked to make my training as effective as possible with the mileage I did, which was never really high. I averaged about 35-40km per week last year, but managed to get PRs in the 10k, 15k and HM of respectively 37:32, 55:42 and 1:23:18. The HM and 15k PRs were in October and November of 2024. 

These PRs gave me the idea a sub3 marathon was possible, but I did know I had to increase my mileage by a lot. Which was a challenge, as I have a young family with a 2-year-old daughter. I decided to follow a little tuned down version of Pfitzinger 18/55, as the original program seemed too time intensive to fit in. I tuned the miles down a little and fitted it with my personal schedule. The original program is about 1300km's in 18 weeks, I planned to do 1200.  

The first 10 weeks of the program went really well, I could consistently increase my weekly mileage without too much discomfort. My highest mileage week before the program was 52km, and 7 weeks in I hit 70km. Apart from a skipped training due to slight Achilles tendon pain, which was gone the next training, it went great. I did 3 70km+ weeks but then unfortunately I got seriously injured. In a week with my longest run thus far, 27k with MP and 10k pace intervals, the next hard training, 10k at LT pace (in which I ran a PR of 37:20) I injured the tendon of my big toe in my left foot. I noticed it when I woke up the day after the LT training and could barely walk. I hoped for a comparable situation as with the Achilles tendon weeks prior, which fixed itself quite fast. But after 3 days rest doing a recovery run, I knew it was bad as I had to stop before even running 1km.  

I went to the physician which told me it was not an inflammation, but rather an annoyed tendon shaft due to too tight shoes. In the LT training I was running in my new carbon shoes, in which I had run 3 times prior, but not in as hard a training as this. It probably caused my injury, and my physician said I should keep at least a week rest from running, biking was okay, and should build up after that, the marathon was still possible!  

The last 8 weeks were balancing between running, biking, and not letting the injury get worse. Because I kept running, the injury did not got time to properly heal, but it got slightly less and less. I decided to give it a week more rest and try a 32k to decide if the marathon was possible. Going into the 32k, with MP blocks of 3,5 and 8km, I did not feel completely fit but did it off as just a cold. Everything in that training went bad, my heartrate rose too quickly, it was warm, and I didn't have enough water (underestimated my acclimation) and my stomach got upset. I called quits at 25,5k, had my wife pick me up and felt sick the rest of the day with about 15 times on the toilet. This was only 3 weeks out from the marathon. 

The positive thing was I did not feel my injury much, and it didn't get worse on a longer distance, so maybe the marathon was possible. I continued with about 20-25km per week after and managed to do one more long run of 24k but something felt a bit off. Ever since getting sick on the 25,5k training, my heartrate was about 5-10 bpm higher than before on all paces. I monitor it by watch, so I know it is not 100% accurate, but this was consistent over multiple training sessions. For example, before my injury I did 17km at 4:07 HR 154, my last MP training the week before the race I did 8km at 4:14 HR 159. This changed specifically after the 25,5k training, as after my injury and before this run I did some runs where my heartrate was comparable to before my injury. This made me really doubt my strategy because with the injury, and this heartrate info, I had no idea what was possible. I knew I would start, but I've never went into a race with so little data about what was possible.  

**Pre-race** 

I picked up my starting bib the day before to reduce stress on racing day. I did not do anything fancy with food and carbloading as I did not have a proper trial run in training. Ate some more simple carbs, and lots of white race as dinner the day before, but nothing that was too drastically different than my normal nutrition.  

Waking up I felt good, my sleep that night was good, as were the nights before, I was able to get some food (actually quite a lot) in and everything, even my number 2, went according to schedule. Due to this I felt pretty relaxed and had a good time when meeting a friend and coworkers who were running as well. I was in the starting area 40 minutes before the start. It was quite crowded already, there was room for stretching but not for a proper warm up jog. 

**Race** 

When it comes to running, I'm quite stubborn. Even though I knew I had low mileage the last 8 weeks, and my longest run was 15km short of a marathon, I needed to know if sub 3 was possible, so I went off on that pace. Weather conditions were okay, 13 degrees C (55 F), mostly clouded, sometimes sun, but quite some wind. Even though it was crowded, I could start in the correct pace range and was not bothered by other runners or had to bother other runners myself.  

I settled in nicely, and even though my heartrate was higher, just as I've seen in my trainings since getting sick from the 25k, I decided to go on RPE and it felt nice. I managed to run very consistently, and got my gels in at the right times, so energy wise I should be okay. I didn't really like the gels, they were a bit worse on the stomach then in training, but I did not have to puke so it was good enough. Next to this, my foot injury which I felt through all trainings the last 8 weeks was nearly gone. It was still there a little bit, but didn't bother me, and didn't get worse the further I got. I was happy with how I managed to balance training the last weeks with this result. 

I felt strong and composed for the first 30k, had a slight doubt at 24k, but when the gel I had just a short time before kicked in everything felt strong again. But I knew this didn't mean anything, as I wasn't at 32k yet and with my preparation I still felt it could go either way. In hindsight, sub 3 was never really realistic, and I would find that out soon enough. 

At 32k I realized I had to let go the sub 3h scheme if I wanted to finish, and tried to find a pace I could sustain. 5km's after this, at 37k, the wall hit tremendously hard. I believe it wasn't due to nutrition, as I know from experience how it feels to be out of carbs. This was something else, I had a sting in my lungs, felt as if I couldn't take in all oxygen from breathing and my Achilles tendon, knees and hamstrings hurt, but fortunately did not cramp up. I just couldn't run anymore. I started walking. This transition made my body realize what I had done to it, I felt tingly sensations through my legs and hands, got dizzy and felt as if I could pass out. ‘How can I ever get to the finish?’ went through my head. I had water on me, so drank a little and the short amount of rest and lots of people in the audience cheering did give me some motivation to alternate walking and running and keep going. In this most difficult part of the race, a quote went through my head I've read in the weeks before the marathon: “The marathon is a different kind of beast” ,I now realized what this means and how it feels.  

At about 40k, my heart rate was down a little compared to just before I had to walk and I could give all I had to finish the last 2,2km's running to the finish line. At 500m from the finish, my wife, daughter, father and friends were standing at the fence, and I passed a meter in front of them, they yelled my name and cheered me on. I didn't notice any of it and just ran past them focusing everything I had left, which wasn't much, on getting my body to the finish line. There it was, I could finally stop.  

**Post-race** 

I got some water, sports drink and a banana as soon as I could, and walked through the finish zone to the gates where we could get off the course. I actually felt pretty okay, which felt weird as I just died a hundred deaths. I had to sit down, off course, and couldn't keep long conversations, but my stomach was fine, and I could talk about the race with people, have some fun. I account how I felt for a part to having to finish at a pace I normally run my recovery runs at, this was probably good for recovery immediately after the race. 

I had a quite normal evening, could play with my daughter, do some household chores, I was really happy with how I felt, but knew the muscle ache would come the days after. 

I had a bad night, couldn't find a comfortable position as everything started to hurt. But this was part of the experience and didn't bother me too much. As I'm typing this a day after, my body is very sore, which was expected. To let my foot finally properly heal, I plan to not run for at least 3 weeks, I'll be on the bike, and do some hiking, but running will come later.  

**Final thoughts** 

Could I have had a better result if I didn't aim for sub 3? Most likely, but I do not regret this strategy, as I really wanted to know if it was possible. I've learned a lot, especially how important mileage is for endurance. I was very much challenged mentally, going back to running in the last KMs after walking is the most difficult thing I've ever done in a race. This lessons and experience will make me a better runner, and I've learned a lot about training and training types which will lead to an improved training schedule next time. 

I'm very proud of the result, this was simply everything that was in the tank. And with the last 8 weeks of my preparation, still a result to be very happy with. Especially since it was my first ever marathon. "

I recognize the active members of this sub are primarily male, but I hope this is a beneficial addition to the race report collection for the female runners and lurkers out there who may be currently or in the future hoping to train and race during pregnancy! There aren’t too many similar race reports out there, but the ones I did find were hugely beneficial to me. If you have any other questions after reading my race report, please don’t hesitate to reach out in the comments or via DM.

**### Background**

I’ll try to keep this relatively brief while still providing some context! I’m 34F, have been running for about 10 years, but very casually until the end of 2021 when I met my now-coach (who reads here sometimes? hi!) who thought I could probably BQ on my first marathon with the proper training. I did - ran an aggressively negative-split 3:18 at Grandma’s last year, then ran a 1:31 half in November. I was aiming to get faster at shorter distances in the first half of 2023, run my first Boston for fun, and then attempt a 3:0X marathon in fall/winter 2023, likely at CIM. At the same time, my husband and I had been trying for our first baby for about 2 years and had recently started fertility treatment; I found out I was finally pregnant in early January.

My OB was aware of my pre-pregnancy activity level and okay-ed the marathon with the instructions to stay hydrated, don’t overheat, and to keep my exertion level/heartrate in check. So far, I’ve been fortunately to have a normal and low-risk pregnancy. I knew I’d likely be able to \*finish\* a marathon while pregnant, but what I wasn’t sure of (and what’s probably more relevant to this sub) is, having never been pregnant before and having only completed one marathon, was how close or far off my pre-pregnancy paces I would be. I was starting off way more fit than my 3:18 last summer, but I was also spending most of my energy growing a human, and my body would be changing by the week.

**### Training**

I kept my spring race calendar the same and ran a 10k in early February (40:04 at 8wks pregnant) and a half in early March (1:29:56 on a tough \[but maybe slightly short\] course, feeling slightly less great at 12wks pregnant). I was averaging \~45 mpw during the 10k/HM block, running 6 days a week with one day of speedwork and one long run with quality blocks. I was able to keep up with my schedule during the first trimester, and while I didn’t always feel amazing and dealt with some cramping and abdominal pain (worst weeks were 4-7) plus fatigue, I didn’t have any debilitating nausea or other major symptoms that prevented me from running. Speedwork was the most challenging, and I stopped training at paces under HM after the 10k race.

I only had 6 weeks between my half and Boston, which included a week of recovery/transition, long runs of 14, 18, and 22 miles (all with marathon pace blocks), then back down to 14 for the taper. Although my 10k and HM races earlier in pregnancy would indicate a marathon equivalent somewhere in the 3:05-3:10 range, I wasn’t planning on trying for anything close to that given my pregnancy was continuing to progress, plus I had a very limited build. I ran my marathon pace miles in the 7:45-7:50 range and tentatively targeted a 3:25 “ish” A goal (7:50 pace). I also knew I’d need at least one bathroom stop (definitely a factor that contributed to discomfort on my long runs as baby grew).

It was definitely a weird process to be reaching peak intensity/mileage weeks of training while simultaneously losing fitness/getting slower. I probably felt best around 15 weeks, but that could have just been a good day/a good point in the training cycle. It’s probably also worth noting I was 103 lbs pre-pregnancy and am currently around 119 at 18.5 weeks. That’s a lot of weight to gain for anyone and was a 15%+ increase from my pre-pregnancy weight, which was definitely noticeable while running, especially at race paces. (It’s been an uncomfortable part of the process, but I’ve been trusting my body/hunger cues and certainly wouldn’t do anything to compromise baby’s health for a race that’s supposed to be for fun. I have never been and may never again be as hungry as I was marathon training while pregnant.)

**### Pre-race**

My husband and I took a Thursday night red-eye from the west coast to Boston. We have family in the area that we’ve been visiting/staying with. Saturday was a busy day with the expo, marathon events, and meeting up with friends. Sunday was a quieter day. I ran 45 minutes with strides on Saturday, 35 on Sunday.

Monday morning started off very poorly as I fell down a few stairs on the way to get dropped off at Boston Commons! (My nephew has a lot of allergies, so I was eating my bagel + PB outside on the porch and fell on the wet stairs on the way down to the car.) Landed on my butt and elbows and then had that to worry about all day. Logistics-wise, everything went smoothly with gear check, the buses (although I think I had the only seatmate who wasn’t chatty at all - we rode in silence the whole way), and the time in Athlete’s Village, where I shed my throwaway layers and shoes. Nutrition-wise, I drank a Maurten 320 on the bus and at a pop-tart in AV, but I forgot my pre-race gel. Used the portas at both AV and the final stop by the CVS.

I wasn’t rushing exactly, but I didn’t have much time between the last bathroom stop and getting to my corral for the start. It was lightly raining at this point, so I kept my poncho on until the last second. It wasn’t exactly clear which line/mat was the actual start line, so I may have started my watch a little early.

**### Race**

My plan was to go out around marathon goal pace through mile 16, hold effort steady (so pace would drop a bit) on the hills, and try for a bit faster than MP for the last 10k.

I went out around the right pace, but unlike my first marathon last year, it didn’t feel effortless. I didn’t feel awful, but definitely felt like I was working somewhat even early on. Not a great sign, but not unexpected given I was running with a passenger. I settled in around the 10k mark and started to enjoy myself more. I tried to get the benefit of running in a large pack without getting pulled along too much by folks running a little faster than I intended to.

I took a single sip of either water or Gatorade at most aid stations to stay hydrated without accelerating the inevitable pee stop (my goal was to only have one of these total). I had originally planned to have a gel (alternating Maurten and Huma) every 4 miles starting at mile 4, but since I missed the pre-race gel, I started these at mile 3 instead.

I enjoyed the crowds, although I don’t think I’m a person that draws as much energy from big crowds as many others seem to. Once the mile markers got into the double digits, time started to go more quickly as I had more upcoming milestones to look forward to (the halfway point, the Wellesley scream tunnel, seeing my family after mile 17, the end of the hills, then the final 10k!)

I took my one (much needed) pee stop right after the mile 16 marker and before the climbs began. I saw my family after the mile 17 marker, which gave me a boost. I also passed them my visor, which I hadn’t needed up until that point - ended up being a big mistake, as it started pouring shortly thereafter.

I did my best to maintain effort on the hills and knew my pace would drop; I think I still passed more people than I was passed by, but I was mostly focused on my own run. I live/train in San Francisco and while I sought out flatter parts of the city for my training, I’m no stranger to hills.

After the hills, I was mostly okay but definitely starting to feel the effects of the distance; my legs were getting a little tired, my ankles were feeling the miles, and the lower abdominal pressure/soreness that became a thing on long runs once baby got to a certain size was definitely noticeable. I told myself I didn’t have to go any faster if I didn’t want to, I just couldn’t slow down, which felt like a very reasonable ask. I *very* incrementally sped up for the last 3.2 miles (I felt I *could* have added more speed but at the expense of being very uncomfortable, which is something I was trying to avoid).

I had more family on Boylston St. itself and looked for them on the finishing stretch, but no luck in locating. No sprint finish but I did keep pace through the finish line, and made sure not to stop my watch until well after the finish line to avoid messing up yet another set of finish line photos.

**### Post-race**

Slow walked through the finish chute and started to get cold very quickly. Met a woman who spotted my shirt (which said “Baby’s First Boston”) and congratulated me; she ran a marathon while pregnant with each of her 4 children! The shirt was a fun visual that got me some extra cheers along the race route. Met up with my husband and oldest nephew after retrieving my gear, hopped on the green line, and proceeded to get stuck on a stopped train for nearly an hour before we were finally allowed to leave, walk back up the stairs to exit the station, and then had to walk to the next nearest stop on the line we needed (my legs were not happy about this). All in all, it took about 3 hours to get back, just enough time for a quick shower before a celebratory dinner with the whole family.

This was the last real race on my calendar until after baby’s arrival this September, although I’ll run a few local club races for fun later this spring and early summer. While my finish time isn't what I would have hoped for pre-pregnancy, I’m still pleased with the result and my ability to train at this volume (45-55 mpw, plus horseback riding, cross-training, strength, and yoga) nearly halfway into my pregnancy. I hope to continue running as far into my pregnancy as possible but will likely cut down to 4/5 days a week, reduce volume and intensity, and increase cross-training to minimize impact.

I definitely feel like I’m just getting started with the marathon and hope to shave off some significant time in the future, but that will have to wait for a while as I focus on the second half of my pregnancy, then postpartum recovery and of course the minor feat of caring for an infant!

The race itself was great, well organized, and super fun! Ending the race on the infamous Hayward Field track is epic.

I am a 50 year old female who has been running casually but consistently for 14 years, averaging 15-20 miles per week when not training for a race. Did a couple 2 hour halfs about 10 years ago and then my running partner moved away so didn't feel motivated to sign up for races on my own. Fast forward to last fall, I signed up for a half which I ran in december in 2:01:33 at a 9:16 min/mile pace.

At this point distance was feeling really good. After that half I was loving 10 mile runs and 13 miles didn't seem enough of a challenge, so I signed up for my first full. I followed Hal Higdon's novice 2 all the way through.  However, I couldn't really fit in the cross training days because I work 2 to 3, 12 hour shifts on my feet every week, and can't work out on those days, and need to also prioritize my family. I ran consistently 4 days a week and sometimes could fit in a 5th. I added a little mileage in to my easy days because I really wanted to get to 40 miles per week at the peak. I resisted zone 2 running because it felt uncomfortably slow and my easy pace felt very easy and talkable (could my garmin HR be wrong?). Most of my long runs were in zone 3 for the majority of the time per my watch. I did my long runs at a 10:30 pace and my speed runs (up to 8 miles) at a 9:00-9:10 pace. My 20 miler felt hard but great, and my last two miles home are always the flattest and was able to speed up to a 9:30 finish my last 1.5 miles. I decided my goal pace for the marathon would be 10:00 min miles for a 4:22 total time.

Week of race: I had the taper flu, the taper tantrums, poor sleep, terrible spring allergies, you name it. I was a mess. My 3 mile runs marathon week felt hard for some reason and I thought I was doomed. I carb loaded 8g/kg for 2 days prior, and hydrated well.

Race day: I woke up at 4:30 and ate a bagel with peanut butter, banana and honey and one 12 ounce cup of coffee (all which I had practiced). I sipped on 500ml of water, and finished this in about an hour. I was off to the shuttle at 5:45. I sat next to a guy who had run Boston on monday and was running the marathon today (what?!?). I thought of him the whole time. I used a running belt to carry my 8 gels and gummies (I like to mix it up) and I decided to carry a throw away 480 ml water bottle with Scratch electrolytes and carbs in it in my hand so I wouldn't have to stop for a while. One of my two headphones didn't work for some reason when I got to the starting line so that was my only bummer of the morning.  I also didn't do a full warm up, I went to the bathroom twice and got my things organized and time went quick.

The race: I felt absolutely fantastic for the first 13 miles! I really wanted to hit my target 4:22 and so I was running more at a 9:50-9:55 pace to account for bathroom stops, etc... Because I had my handheld water/electrolytes for the first 7 miles and all my fuel in my belt, I didn't stop at all until at least mile 8 for hydration which was different than during training. I bought a new belt for the marathon that allowed easy access to everything without stopping AND I had pockets on my shorts. During training I always had to stop to get things out. I fueled every 3 miles with either a Maurten, a Gu, or Clif blocks. After I finished my handheld I took one water and one gatorade at every stop. Around my 13, I felt a twinge of something in my right quad, just sort of an injurious uncomfortable feeling, but not over the top bad, that stuck with me for the rest of the race. For some reason during races this is always the spot that gets me, but never during training and then it extends to the right side of my knee (IT band?). Mile 13 was always hard for me mentally as well during my last two long training runs, as things are starting to get hard yet you are only at half the distance you know you need to go. I still was able to keep pace overall and feel pretty good to mile 20. I had a pee stop at mile 10 and mile 15ish, and was starting to think I was overhydrating. Mile 20-26 was hard, and I was cursing everything. I don't think I ""hit a wall"", but my quads were just sooooo tired and felt like they were freezing up. The rest of me felt fine. I had thought I would feel great for this portion as I did at the end of all my long training runs, but that definitely did not happen. I had to pee twice (again that is 4 times on the course, was I over hydrated?) although also using this a a great excuse to stop for a minute. I also stopped at all the hydration stops for gatorade and a quick stretch in the last 6 miles. This slowed my pace down considerably to an 11:00 minute mile. With the bathroom stops early on, my final time was 4:36:44, 10:34/mile. This was slower than my training long runs, where did I go wrong? Is it normal to feel like your quads are just done at the end of a marathon? I definitely think strength training might have helped. Any suggestions? Because of course during those last 6 miles I said I would never do this again, but of course I will:)"

# Background

32M. This was my second proper HM. Have known that I have a decent predisposition to long distance running but never taken it super seriously. Have run a few races including a big 14k fun run in Sydney, but never broke the 60min barrier (was always 62ish). Never used to properly train for races, except doing more ""runs"". Joined a run club over here and got more into running, but was only doing it once per week. I did run some more HM's with them, and it changed my perception of the distance after an awful first attempt years ago (IBS halfway through, not fun!!). Mid-way through 2024 I did a 5km and clocked in at 20mins flat, which killed me. But wasn't really exercising much and then for the last few months of 2024, wasn't exercising at all. Did a HM in Feb, based off some ""unserious"" training (30ish KM p/w) for 6 weeks prior and did it in 1:34:04. Right around the 4:27 plateau I've always had which made me realise I need to do something different. Decided to give a proper training block a go, and actually asked on here whether I could get down to a 1:25 in 11 weeks. Of course that was immediately noted as extremely ambitious given it was my 5km time, so decided on a goal of 1:28. 

# Training

Immediately after the Feb HM I found this subreddit and started looking at training plans, but was completely overwhelmed (had no idea what temp or threshold was). The big unlock for me came with discussing this with Chatgpt, and it created a hybrid Pfitzinger/Daniels plan which it describes as ""Your training block was a hybrid of Daniels’ structured intensity and Pfitzinger’s aerobic volume, blending tempo runs, VO2 max intervals, and progressive long runs with fast finishes. It focused on building threshold strength and race-specific endurance, rather than pure mileage stacking or excessive speedwork—giving you a well-rounded, efficient base to peak off.""

Chatgpt ended up being fantastic for my training. I got into a flow of sharing my workouts and long run garmin data with it and then discussing the runs. It was able to track my progress with actual data. It was also very helpful midway through the block where I struggled to hit some of the long run, last 5k HM pace finishes that the plan had and was lacking confidence. Eventually I was able to break through, which was an awesome feeling at the time. It was also very helpful to have a much richer understanding of my training and my body, firstly in terms of how a block is supposed to go, and then other things such as exploring HR's and mentally how I approach runs and races. This made the block very enjoyable as I was learning a lot about running and myself throughout, and it got a lot of written and actual data about my running. I am going to continue using it for training moving forward, with me inputting of where I want to go and different training styles. 

Completed all my workouts (I really enjoyed talking them through with chatgpt post workout) and skipped a few easy runs. Mileage peaked around 70km for a week - which is when I started to feel a lot of fatigue. Deloaded the next week, before jumping back into the 60ish range for 3 weeks before a 3 week taper. Was sick a couple of weeks ago and took it very easy in the taper. Apart from the fatigue, had no injuries or nigels affect any of my training.

# Pre-race

Had a big bowl of pasta late afternoon the evening prior. Woke up early and had 2 cream cheese bagels with a few coffees. Stayed at home rather than facing the lines at the race and got the business done. Also had 1L of electrolytes the night before and the morning of. Couple quick strides beforehand and that was it really. 

# Race

Had heard there was some deceptive hills from friends who had done the HH prior and had discussed the plan with Chatgpt in the week prior. Hackney has been pretty hot previously, but was perfect this year (overcast, 12-14 degrees). I really enjoy progression runs, so planned to take it easy until 8km in and then slowly get faster. I decided to pace on HR rather than pace (which I roughly knew anyway), as I knew I would blow up if my HR reached high 160's early. I tend to redline over 170. 

In terms of the race I think I did it pretty textbook. I took water at most of the stations, though felt quite bloated in the back half and was annoyed with the cups, rather than bottles. I felt my pace drop back 20 odd seconds taking water which was annoying + letting it digest into the system. I also took 3 gels at 7km, 14km & 18km. 

I focused on HR for the first half which served me well and was excited to get to the back end to finally see how all this training translated on race day. This went well and my HR peaked in the last 5km with a 171 avg (4:05km avg pace). Had my Adios Pro 4's on which were great. Mid-way through the race what I really liked was switching my garmin to the lap time, and just focusing on bringing that lap pace down each KM. From 14-20km I pretty much forgot about the total distance and was only focused on the getting the lap KM time down to my target which was great. Felt very much like I was pacing myself, vs using other people. Ended up with a good clean negative split across each 5km.

Really fun race and the support is fantastic! Felt like a champ running near London Fields, where the support was deep. 

# Post-race & Reflections

Many a beer was consumed and my running club mates smashed some PB's which was great. It's an awesome day out and I really recommend to go either as a runner or a supporter. 

  
If you can't already tell, ChatGPT was a fantastic resource and I was really happy with my progress. I am definitely doing a marathon but going to do one next year and continue getting quicker this year. Always been a life goal to do a sub 3hr marathon, which I definitely know I'm capable of. Keen to see how some more blocks add to my base speed and hopefully do a sub 3 on my first attempt which would make me super proud. In terms of training for the rest of the year, I've seen this Norweigan Singles Method discussed on here. And so I've been talking it through with ChatGPT and going to give that a go and see how I get on with some 10k and HM races this year.

### Training
 I signed up for this marathon back in June, two months after setting a personal best in the Brooklyn Half (1:27:30). I’d always wanted to run a full marathon, but honestly, the idea was incredibly nerve-wracking. I knew how tough that half marathon felt—I couldn’t even imagine doubling the distance. 

To prepare, I also signed up for the Jersey City Half as an early tune-up to gauge my fitness. For the BK Half, I used the Pfitz 12/55 plan but had to shorten it to 10/55 after getting injured early in the cycle. This time, I wanted to up my game. I committed to the 12/70 plan for the full marathon. I considered the 18/70 plan but decided against it because I needed to build my mileage gradually. I was at about 40 MPW in early August and needed time to hit 50+ comfortably. I entered the plan feeling healthy-ish. My Achilles was always a little sore in the mornings—something I’ve come to think of as a summer thing since it usually goes away in winter. The first few weeks of the plan in September felt manageable. 

I bumped my mileage to around 65+ and ran the Jersey City Half, shaving 20 seconds off my PR with a 1:27:30. I was happy with the result but had been aiming for 1:25. I’d heard that 1:25 was the benchmark for a sub-3 marathon, which became my ultimate goal for my first marathon. Going sub-3 felt like more than just an achievement—it was a way to signal to myself that I was on the right path with running. I like setting lofty goals: shoot for the moon, land on the stars. Even if I blew up and ran a 3:07, I would’ve been fine with that as long as I gave sub-3 a shot. It sounds ridiculous, but that’s the mindset I had. To complement the Pfitz plan, I lifted three times a week—Monday for core and Wednesday/Friday for heavy compound lifts focused on running (hex bar deadlifts, single-leg RDLs, lunges, etc.). 

I skipped only one recovery session. My mileage peaked at 75 MPW in late October and stayed above 70 for about four weeks. I added extra miles where I could and followed the Pfitz plan almost exactly, only skipping a recovery run now and then. The taper felt unnecessarily long—honestly, it was—but I went into race day feeling nervous yet optimistic. I’d done a ton of Googling, and most calculators based on my half-marathon times suggested 3:05 was my ceiling. But I knew I could do sub-3.


### Pre race

I woke up at 4:30 a.m., did my warm-up, made a much-needed movement, and then ate some oatmeal and a banana before heading to the race. My brother and sister-in-law were huge helps the entire weekend, shepherding me from place to place and even following along the route. It was lovely having them there.  I got to my corral (B) hoping to find a 3:05 pacer. The plan was to stick with them until around mile 18 and then make my move. But there was only a 3:10 pacer and a 3:00 pacer. I talked to both to get a sense of their plans. Pacers are half therapists, half pacers—ha. Both were aiming for even splits, which sounded good to me.  I decided to just go for it, trust myself, and stick with the 3:00 pacer. If I blew up, at least I’d know I gave it everything. I avoided jumping around too much to conserve energy. For fueling, I brought six Maurten 100 gels. No caffeine—I don’t usually do caffeine, and I didn’t want to risk it spiking my BPM artificially.  The horn fired, and we were off.


### The Race
For the first few miles, I worried I’d gone out too hot. I’d read so many race reports about people blowing up after a fast start, and with my half-marathon fitness earlier this year, I kept glancing at my watch and BPM, convinced I might have messed up. Seeing my brother and sister-in-law at mile 2 got me emotional—I teared up a little. But my BPM kept creeping into the 170s, and I felt like I needed to calm down. I was pressed that I’d overcooked it. Then I hit mile 5, running through the city center (I think), and there were these massive speakers blasting Future’s “BRAZZIER.” I know, it sounds ridiculous, but I didn’t hear much hip-hop from the crowd along the route, and that bassline was unmistakable. At this point, I decided to just LOCK IN. I switched my watch display to show just distance, time, and lap pace and told myself, “You’re going to sub-3 your first marathon.” I repeated it like a mantra.

 
Catching up to the 3:00 pacers, I kept them in sight, trailing about 10 seconds behind. Miles 8 to 13 took us out of the city, and things got quieter. Running with the 3:00 pacers was special, though—you’d hear the crowd yelling, “YOU’RE GOING TO BREAK 3!!” Every time, I thought, “Yes, I am.” I had a few close calls at water stations—some people were polite, others a little less so—but I hadn’t run in a pack like this before, so adjusting was tricky. At one point, I drifted from the pack and tucked in behind taller runners to draft and conserve energy. As a motor racing fan, it was pretty cool to do this in real life. I crossed the halfway point at 1:30:12 and reminded myself again, “You’re going to sub-3 your first marathon.” 

I made friends along the way and was recording selfie videos to capture my lap pace. Clown me if you want, but I wanted to capture my first marathon in a cool way. Maybe I lost a minute doing this, but I didn’t care. Miles 13 to 18, where I expected things to start getting tough, went smoother than I anticipated. I trusted my training and focused on conserving energy on the downhills, letting momentum carry me. Around mile 18, I met another runner who asked me my goal. “Sub-3,” I told him. He nodded and said, “Okay, bro, we’re both going sub-3 today.” We locked in together. 

Running up Main Street to the turnaround was wild. The energy from the crowd was insane. I didn’t cheer back—trying to conserve every bit of energy—but Philly, y’all showed up for me, and I felt it. I caught up to the pacer around this time and asked if we were on track. He said we were early, but his plan was to finish at exactly 3:00. I felt ready and decided to make my move around mile 23 with my new running buddy from mile 18. Miles 23 to 26.2 were a blur. The wall didn’t hit me until mile 25, and even then, it was more mental than physical. I told myself, “You’re going to sub-3 your first marathon. Lock in.” And I did. The finish line came into view, and I gave it everything I had. As soon as I crossed, I stopped my watch and collapsed to the ground. My time? 2:58:12.


### Post Race
Honestly, I’m still floored. As I sit here writing this, my thighs are on fire, and walking down stairs two days later feels like an extreme sport. Insane.  That said, I’m planning to follow the Pfitz recovery plan and gradually build back to 50+ miles per week by January 2025, aiming to hit 60 comfortably after that. My next big goal is the United Half in March, where I’m shooting for a 1:25 or better. Fingers crossed—I’ll see how it goes!  Also, I can’t thank the pacers enough. Without them, I’m sure I would’ve overcooked it. Locking into their pace was a game changer, keeping me steady and focused when I might’ve otherwise burned out. Truly, they made all the difference. O, and Future. One of the greatest rappers of all time. Fight me.

**Training**

I (32M, 145 lbs, 5'7"") ran the Big Sur marathon last year and ran a 3:21 on the modified course, which was modified due to a terrain slip-out in March 2024. I ran a 2:55 at the San Antonio R&R marathon in December and continued to build off that. My peak mileage was 92 miles (148 km) with most weeks between 70-80 mpw (112-128 kpw). I would run 6-7 times per week with two hard workouts (8-mile (12.8 km) thresholds @ 6:00 min/mile (3:44 min/km) pace, hill repeats, 800m repeats) and one long run (longest was 22 miles/35 km). I lifted 4 times per week (2x leg days on the same days as speed workouts, 2x upper body days). I bought Nike Alphaflys and ran a 1:21 half marathon during the build-up without going at an all-out effort. That and several other workouts gave me the confidence that I could hit my goals. 

**Pre-race**

Taper went fairly smoothly (week 1 - 80% of peak mileage, week 2 - 60%, week 3 - 40%). However, I did not feel completely rested by the end of the three week taper. I did not lift during the final week. Carb load was just okay. We were staying with friends before the race, and I stuffed my face with cookies regularly. I was feeling very bloated at the start line and did not want to eat any more carbs. In retrospect, I could have cleaned up my nutrition considerably. However, I did not drink any booze for the weeks leading up to the marathon and was sleeping extremely well up through race week. 

**Race**

It was a rainy start with a consistent drizzle. I ran at goal pace through mile 8 till the first hill and slowed down a bit. This was to be expected. I could not stomach any more gus though and only managed 3 gus throughout the course. Miles 11 and 12 were the incline up to Hurricane Point (4.5% grade over 2 miles). I really slowed down there and took a few walking breaks for a few seconds just to lower my heart rate. I continued running but felt extremely fatigued. The rolling hills, headwind, and rain were a struggle. The bank and camber of the road greatly reduced the stability of the Nike Alphaflys. I was not stepping directly on top of the soles/plates of the shoes which I think limited their spring effect. I continued pushing but could not keep pace and gradually saw each of my goals slip out of reach. The final miles I resigned to not achieving them and focused on finishing. 

Still, the Big Sur Marathon is the most stunning course I've ever run. Luckily the weather did not obscure the jagged coast much. We drove the course the day prior to snap all the photos. Coming over Hurricane Point and hearing the piano music carried by the wind was a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I was so grateful to do the course again after having the race altered in 2024. 

**Post-race**

I choked. While the course is unforgiving, I ultimately came up short. My goals and fitness did not align with the terrain. Things I would have done differently: 

1. Integrate hills during threshold runs. 

2. Consume more quality foods during the carb load (still, I love cookies). 

3. Train for the course first, then train for the time. 

4. Wear shoes with greater stability. The Nike Alphaflys are great shoes, but I think they achieve best performance on completely flat surfaces. 

I want to BQ but will need to find another race before September to make it happen. 

Happy running! "

Apologies for the broken lap in the middle. Someone bumped into my watch.

**Background:**

I'm 28M, 6ft 170lbs. Started running in 2019 and went straight from no athletic background into training for my first marathon. Looking back this likely wasn't the best approach but I did a 16 week block from zero to running the same race in 2019 in a 4:28.

Since then I've done about 7 marathons but really put in two serious training blocks in 2023 with a 3:28 in Paris Marathon and a 3:11 in Valencia Marathon December 2023.

During the Valencia training block I had to cut back to training 2/3 days per week due to a knee injury. I was initially aiming for sub 3 in this race but knew with the minimal amount of miles (30MPW) I had to adjust my target. Surprisingly this race went well, didn't hit a wall and came in with a 3:11.

That said, post race my knee injury flared up massively and I took about 8 months off running completely.

**Training:**

That leads me to the training for this race which started with slowly ramping up my mileage from September 2024 into the start of this training block which kicked off mid January.

I was averaging about 40-50 MPW in December took a short 2 week break in January and then got back to training and ended up following the PFitz 16-week plan - 55Mile through the race.

Training went very well, seeing improvement week over week and rarely missing a session or having to cut any short.

My average mileage was around 40 - 50 MPW with a 61 Mile peak week and then a 3 week taper.

Unfortunately, I ended up with the flu for the two weeks prior to the marathon but felt about 95% on race day.

**Pre-Race:**

I was more nervous than I had ever been for a race mainly due to being sick prior to the day and just hoping I could hold up. The race is local to me so I got a good sleep and headed down to the race about an hour before ready to hit the start line.

**The Race:**

This was the hardest race of my life. In both Paris and Velencia it got hard at the end but I was able to maintain pace and never felt like I hit a wall. This one was different.

I set out with the 3 hour pacers but looking at my splits I feel like this is where I potentially could have done better. We went out FAST. The pacers were trying to bank a minute in the first half of the race as the second half is much more difficult. I ended up going through the half around 1:28:3X setting a half marathon PB.

In all my previous races I have negative split or had even splits so knew this was going to get very tough.

There is a couple of serious hills around the 16 - 19 Mile mark which is where the wheels started to fall off. I had never wanted to drop out of a race so much. That said, there's a big downhill section around mile 20 which gave me some relief and I managed to push through the last 6 mile which felt like a slog.

After mile 20 the goal was just to get over the line as I knew sub 3 was out the window. I was disappointed during the race but am proud looking back that I managed to hold the pace I did and come in with an 8 minute PB on a much tougher course than Valencia.

My main question here is would going out at MP rather than the speed we did have helped me in the second half of the race?

**Post-Race:**

Post race I was delighted to be finished and get over the line and honestly very happy with the 3:02:48 I crossed the line. My wife and family where all there and we enjoyed a lot of food and even more beers.

I've been out for a few jogs since and my legs have recovered nicely especially compared to previous races.

I'm now signed up for Valencia again in December and am excited to get back to training. I think with another training block and the flat course in Valencia I can probably shoot for a 2:55 - 2:57 but we'll see how training goes.

Onward and upward!

I would love some feedback here on the race strategy as I think a 3:01:XX was probably possible on the day with better pacing."

# Pre-training

The Tokyo Marathon was such an unforgettable experience. It was my first World Marathon (second marathon overall) and everything from start to finish was incredible. Highly recommend for anyone wanting an overseas marathon that is decently flat, highly organized, and gives you a tour of the Tokyo highlights. After participating in a World Marathon, I can now understand why runners seek out the six Abbott Marathons. Maybe I'm feeling this way because I still have lingering effects of that Runner's High, but others must feel this way about the Tokyo Marathon as well.

I participated through a charity and was lucky enough to get in. I applied a day or so after the charity entry opened, and believe I was lucky to get in as many charity options were already closed due to the number of applicants. After that, the process went pretty smoothly, just waiting for emails from the Tokyo Marathon and the Charity. Everything was very well communicated via email; had just the right amount of emails from them to feel in the loop without it feeling like spam.

# Training

For my training I originally sought out a 12 week foundational block (build up to 30-35 miles per week) and then 18 weeks of an intermediate plan, both from the Hal Higdon Marathon Plan website. Between my first marathon in March 2024 and my training block, I was running no more than 50 miles per month, with one of those months only running 18 miles. Thus, I felt like the 12 week base block would get me up to speed.

After I completed the 12 weeks and about a week into the intermediate plan, I felt like I could push myself a bit and decided to switch to Pfitz's 18/55 plan. I really enjoyed the challenging runs and felt like I had more of a purpose during some of the workouts instead of just trying to get the prescribed miles in (even though I still was hyper focused on getting those miles which I think led to my downfall later on in training).

I pretty much followed Pfitz's 18/55 plan down to a tee over the first 9 weeks, getting in all the lactate threshold, recovery, and marathon pace workouts in. I also utilized the treadmill often throughout the plan (accounting for 467 of the 1012 miles during the 30 weeks). During week 10 I skipped out on two 8 mile runs (a VO2 max and aerobic run) due to a road trip and then in week 12 I cut out two miles from my 17 mile run as the previous day I had a 10k tuneup race I ran in 39:49 on a hilly course and began to develop right leg pain...

I couldn't identify the source of the leg pain early on, whether it was from my ankle, hip or knee, and figured it would sort itself out, so I continued to run. During my last marathon training block, I had developed pain to the right groin that had self resolved with rest. I didn't have pain in the groin this time, and I didn't rest.

I felt my best around Week 13. I felt comfortable and strong hitting all the long runs and cardiovascularly, I felt great. My heart rate has peaked up to 171-175 during the high intensity stuff, but has always come back down with an average of 140-150. This week I hit 14 miles in 6:45/mile and felt like I could keep going which was a great sign until the pain set in again.

I continued to run at the prescribed miles up until week 14, when I couldn't run the 10k-15k Tuneup race at a fast pace (7:34/mi over 10k) because of my pain. Despite this, I kept going, having to reduce my 11 mile mid week run the next week down to 7 miles, and then in week 16 the pain was at its peak. I found that at this point the pain would occur from the right lateral ankle up to the knee, possibly the thigh. It almost felt like I was hitting a nerve. It would worsen after hard runs, but then improve somewhat after 1-2 days of rest. Only pain with running, going down stairs, or jumping. I ran my third Tuneup race in week 16, but was limited again by the knee pain (6:43/mi 10k). The next on my long run day, I physically couldn't run for more than a mile due to the pain. I think the pain is to the right knee, and pretty certain I have runner's knee, but it's been difficult to isolate to a location even to this day. I haven't been diagnosed though, so not 100% sure.

Week 17 was a combination of light running and bicycles. I ran a total of 13 miles that week at about a 8:30 mile and combined this with anywhere from 20 to 50 minutes of bicycles for four days that week. I tried to mimic the VO2 workout on the bike the best I could, but my legs weren't used to the high power output on the bike, and I realized that I probably should have worked my legs out in different ways than just running throughout the training block. My leg pain was nonexistent on the bike which was great, and the light running helped but would still have that dull ache to the right knee which was of concern.

# Pre-race: Tokyo, Japan

We fly out to Tokyo the Sunday before the race, week 18 of the training block. I'm still experiencing pain to the right leg but not as significant as it was during week 16. I run a total of 17 miles this week leading up to the marathon, staying around an easy pace, but trying to push myself to marathon pace on a few occasions. Overall I had improvement in the pain, but could still tell there was something going on, and not going through a proper taper was in the back of my mind.

Also, being in a new country/city for the first time, naturally you want to explore and indulge a bit. This was the second contributor to my sub-goal time I think. On top of the training, we walked between 10-12 miles each day that week, so up to 60ish miles on top of the 17 I ran. My legs were pretty conditioned so I didn't feel a real soreness or fatigue the day after, but the cumulative effect certainly affected my race day efforts I believe.

Regarding nutrition leading up to the marathon, I tried to eat carbohydrates smartly, loading up on white rice, udon noodles, fruit juices, oatmeal, etc., whenever I could, but it's hard when there are so many different options you've never tried before. The two days before the marathon, I always started the morning with a bowl of an oatmeal/rice porridge combination, lots of fruit/fruit juices and bread, then throughout the day would eat sushi. I had a large bowl of udon noodles two nights before. The night before I didn't get to eat what I want since we were at a sporting event, and was stuck with the arena's options. I ended up eating a beef bowl with rice, fried chicken bites, French fries, and lots of water. The fried food ended up making me nauseous and I felt it sitting in my stomach the next morning unfortunately. An undisciplined mistake but I don't regret any of it.

# Pre-race

Very fortunate for the late race time at 9:10am! I woke up at around 6am, and had a bowl of oatmeal/rice porridge concoction and some fruit/fruit juice. I did a light jog for like 5-10 minutes and stretched. Hopped on the JR transit at 7:30 which took me to Shinjuku Station, and I walked on over to the entry location. I got past the checkpoints by 8:15am and stood to use the restroom. All super organized and check in was a breeze. At about 8:40ish I went to my coral and just stood there until the start. I wasn't use to this from my past experiences, where I could just show up 5-10 minutes beforehand, rollout of my hotel within walking distance, squeeze into my corral and just go. I took off my long sleeve I purchased from MUJI for like 1000 yen and donated it in the box next to the start area. I also brought a cliff block that I split up and ate the first half at 8:30 and second at 9am.

At 9:00am, there were pre-race intro/ceremonies going on, but couldn't hear or see very well due to the vast amount of people and me sitting in group C. At 9:05am the wheelchair races began, I saw a handful of people jump off to the side to use the restroom briefly since the line had disappeared, so I thought I would do the same. I thought I could just go back to my spot, but was redirected to a side entrance which was further back than where I started. Such a rookie mistake lol. But I'm glad I went because I didn't have to go at all throughout the race.

The gun went off at 9:10am, we started, and I didn't officially cross the start line until about 2-3 minutes afterwards.

# Race

As you can see above, I was all over the place early on with my pacing. During my training block, I really tried to keep my pacing consistent throughout my runs, and my plan going into this was to run at a 6:48-50/mile average for the first half, and push for 6:40-45/mile the second half, but obviously didn't happen like that.

Gear: I had on Nike Alphafly 3's that had about 50 miles on them from training. I wore brief lined shorts and a dry-fit T-shirt and had a belt to keep my phone and energy gels. Weather was great (in my opinion), but did get warmer the last 3 miles. 50ish F the whole way until it started to creep up towards the end. I also wore Powerbeats Pro earphones. I didn't listen to any music the first 8 miles or so as I was taking in the environment. My right earphone died at about mile 14 though sadly.

Nutrition: I used Gus every 30 minutes, until the last hour and went every 15-20 minutes, accounting for 7 total.

The first mile I was just dodging people, trying to establish a good pace and get to the front, but I've never done this before and didn't develop a strategy for this beforehand. I just kept telling myself I need to find the 3hr pacer, but I never caught up due to where I started and they started with the gun. The dodging kept up pretty much the first 10k or so, so it was really difficult establishing a consistency. The half way point was also congested, and this is where I start to decline in my pace a bit.

Concerning my leg injury, I felt it during the entire race. It wasn't a pain per se, but just knew it was there and a slight ache with every step. Perhaps it was the adrenaline that got me through the race regarding this injury, but it kind of affected me mentally. Like, there were times during the harder miles (mile 17-18ish and mile 22) where I caught myself thinking that it's okay if I didn't get my goal pace due to the injury.

The race overall was as expected. An initial decline towards the beginning and relatively flat the rest of the way. There was a significant hill later on, but I forget the mile marker and was able to just push through it. I grabbed water/pocori sweat at each station (often two cups of each), and it was a challenge running while drinking, as my first marathon I would just walk each station.

At about mile 17 I could feel the lactic acid catching up to me a bit, but still continued to push through despite the slowing in pace. Like I stated previously, cardiovascularly I felt great, just the legs. I also had moral boosts from my wife cheering me along the way which accounted for my boosts at the 20/21 mile marks.

At the 23 mile mark, the foam on the bottom of my left shoe seem to combust or something. At first I thought a paper cup was stuck to the bottom and I tried to shake it off, but every step felt significantly different, like less bouncy. At the end I looked and a piece of the foam and plastic on the outside heel tore off somehow lol.

I kept looking at my watch and the kilometer markers the last three miles, and would get discouraged when I saw that my times weren't quite aligning up and that it seemed like I was running further than the 26.2 miles. Legs were significantly heavy but I just kept pushing through despite everything, as I didn't want to stop and lots of people were. My breathing became out of rhythm, and began to feel peak pain in the right leg in addition to the lactic acid buildup these last few miles. Finally, when I saw the finish line, I made a last second burst and crossed. And it was over like that. 

# Post-race

After the race we were ushered based on our bib colors on where to go. Go a bunch of fluids and snacks as I slowly trodded towards the exit. Even though I felt in pain, it didn't feel all that bad, and even though I didn't achieve my goal, I was happy with the outcome. I executed everything I could that was within my control, and adapted to the situations that were out of my control. I love the marathon because of the discipline and journey; you learn quite a bit about yourself throughout training and can carry over those lessons to the inevitable next marathon. 

We had to catch the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) to Osaka later that evening, but in the immediate aftermath I met up with my wife in the sea of people and went to the Charity Room to be greeted by so many volunteers. Such a memorable experience. 

We had everything packed and I did my best to hobble to the trains, sat on the Shinkansen and ate a Bento Box for dinner. The next two days I was pretty tired and sore, but we booked a hotel appropriate for that. Really just chilled for 48 hours before enjoying Kyoto before we headed home. 

Thanks for reading, hope this can be helpful to anyone that wants to run the Tokyo Marathon or has had similar mishaps in their training. My next one will be next year I think, but who knows.

### Preamble

Originally, I had planned to run only two marathons this year, CIM and Napa. However, as my recovery from Napa went smoothly and I realized it was 28 weeks until my next race, the Arkansas Traveller 100, I thought the interval was too long to prepare for just one event. It seemed wiser to split the period into two training blocks with a race in between.

Mid-March, I began looking for races scheduled from mid to late July, considering either a Half or Full Marathon. Then, the San Francisco Marathon appeared. As my cursor hovered over the purchase button, I hesitated. The hesitation was partly due to the steep entry fee, but mostly it was memories of my previous ordeal with this hilly challenge. Although the course had changed, eliminating excessive loops around Golden Gate Park, it wasn’t completely flat. I vividly remembered my dramatic struggle [30 kilometers](https://www.strava.com/activities/2570658946/overview) into that race, where I had started in the ""Semi-Elite"" field only to end up alternating between running and walking the last 12 kilometers, finishing in 3 hours and 18 minutes. Did I really want to attempt this race again? Oops, too late—I had already clicked the button. Damn.


### The Block

With 18 weeks to work with, I divided the training block into three phases:
1. **Phase 1:** A gradual increase to around 70 km (43 miles) per week over 5 weeks.
2. **Phase 2:** Maintain approximately 70 km (44 miles) per week, with a few peak weeks.
3. **Phase 3:** Taper!

Overall, everything went according to plan, with the main deviations being a last-minute entry into a [trail half marathon](https://ultra-daemon.com/texas-switchback) and a 62 km trail run, [Zion Crossing](https://ultra-daemon.com/zion-crossing). This led to a 70-mile (110 km) week at one point. I should also mention that I focused on maintaining a 7-day rolling mileage window, aiming to keep it around 70 to 80 km (42 to 50 miles). I experienced a few minor issues, such as tight ankles, some random back pain from weight lifting, and a bit of Achilles pain, but nothing too serious.

### Shoes

Nike AlphaFly 3.

After the heavy bricks that were the AF2s, these feel magically light and bouncy. I love them!

### Race day

The SF Marathon is notorious for its 5:15 AM start, which, given that I live an hour away, meant waking up at 2:15 AM to be ready in time. I tried to get plenty of sleep the week before to prepare, and I think it helped.

I have a pretty nailed-down system, as this would be my 9th marathon:
- 12 hours before: Pasta dinner
- 3 hours before: Bagel, coffee, and 500 ml of electrolytes (Maurten 320)
- Before the race: Minor sips to quench thirst
- 5 minutes before the race: Eat a gel (Maurten 100 Caf)

### 0 to 18.5kms

The race began with a somewhat awkward start, where a single handcyclist began first, followed by a few runners, and then the rest of the participants. Confused? You can watch a [YouTube video of the start](https://youtu.be/mYUM5s0V20k?t=197). Since the race was all chip-timed, I guess it didn’t matter.

The race is known for its hilly and challenging first section, but in my experience, the rolling hills of the last 15 kilometers are the real challenge for anyone aiming for a sub-3 finish. After analyzing splits from previous years, I settled on this strategy: pace the race for a roughly 2:55 even split. If the second half became difficult, I would aim for a 1:27/1:33 positive split to still achieve a sub-3 finish.

I also decided to run the hills very conservatively, pushing hard for the initial flat 10 kilometers and hitting this in 41 minutes, right on target. While I’ve seen race reports mentioning visibility issues, I found the weather almost perfect, except for a decent headwind. I tucked in behind whoever I could, but the field was already quite spread out, so I had to face the wind more than I would have liked.

I used a new strategy, carrying a 500 ml bottle of water with Maurten 160 electrolytes to boost my total carbohydrate intake. I also adopted a more aggressive gel strategy, consuming as much as I could rather than gradually, aiming for over 80 grams of carbs per hour, which was quite challenging!

Crossing the Golden Gate Bridge and starting the brief climb, I glanced back as I heard thundering footsteps. It was the sub-3 hour pace group! I had expected them to even/negative split the race, so I was somewhat surprised to see them. As I descended the hill towards Marin, I picked up the pace and tucked in behind a few runners who overtook me—perfect. Finally, I was back at the base of the bridge for the ""Garmin Golden Gate Challenge."" I ascended slowly, and as I reached the top, the 3-hour pace group overtook me.


### 18.5km to 31kms

For a split second, I was worried I was falling behind, but then I realized this was excellent luck. The bridge was very windy, so I quickly tucked into the pace group and let them lead. After just over an hour of running, it was nice to turn my brain off and just focus on keeping up with them.

The pacing group maintained a steady pace. As we ascended hills, they pulled away from me because I wanted to take it a bit easier. However, I easily caught up on the downhills. This section was a grind with steep ups and downs as we worked our way into the park. I asked the pacer how he planned to split the rest of the race. He mentioned that we had 3 minutes buffer and would probably finish with a minute to spare. At this point, there was little wind, and the pacer had dragged me a long way, so I decided to revert to my own pacing strategy rather than stick with the group.

Just as I was about to exit the park, I felt a deep, strong pulse in both of my hamstrings. I had felt this pain before, at almost exactly the same point in the same race! Argh, was I about to blow up? Quickly, I slowed down and did some math. I had 50 minutes to run 11 kilometers, which almost perfectly worked out to 4:30 minutes per kilometer (7:19 per mile). I decided to stop pushing for a ~2:55 finish and focus on securing that sub-3.

### 31km to END

I would love to say it was easy from this point on, but quite the contrary—it was a massive grind. The challenge in this part of the race is getting the pacing right. To hit my target pace, I needed to push on the downhills and then try to hold on during the ascents. There was very little purely flat running until the final 4 kilometers.

At this point, I heard a loud cheer from my friend James, and we high-fived. This lifted my spirits, and I was certain I was going to get it done.

Finally, I hit that elusive flat section for the last 4 kilometers. I could hear large cheers behind me for a local female runner. I made it around the ballpark, looked up, and saw 2:58 on the clock. I started to kick and sprinted to the finish. Chip time: 2:59:22!

### Wrap & What's next?

Overall, I was thrilled with the result and wouldn't have changed a single thing about the entire day. Now, it's time to take a few weeks of lower mileage before building back up for the Arkansas Traveller 100!"

Please Include This Information As Well.","Please include the following information in posts requesting marathon time advice.

1. **A time from a recent race.** The race should have been done at proper race effort (i.e., with the intent to do your best that day) and done within the past four to six weeks. *Half-marathons and 10-milers are best.* Although races of longer distances such as 30K have more predictive signal for a marathon time, those are rarer and not as ideal during marathon training as they take much longer to recover from. Races shorter than 10K involve different physiological systems and are not as good for assessing fitness for a marathon. Time trials can substitute actual races if need be. However, they cannot replicate the conditions of actually being in an official race. And if you don't have this, even an estimate of your current half-marathon or 10-miler time would be better than nothing.
2. **Your weekly mileage during your training and what kind of runs you were doing.** Report the number of miles or kilometers you run on a typical week during training as well as your maximum. Did you include tempo runs? Did you regularly include a mid-week mini-long run? Did you have several long runs lasting longer than two hours? Two and a half hours? Runners with higher mileage and more balance in their training (e.g., running six days a week with a tempo run on Tuesday, a mini-long run of nine to twelve miles on Thursday, a long run on Sunday, and recover runs of three to five miles on every other day as opposed to someone who does one long run on Sunday and two short runs during the week) will be more prepared and are more likely to be able to handle a more aggressive marathon target time.
3. **Your running history, including the number of marathons you have run before.** Newer runners and those about to do their first marathon should target a more conservative time. Experience helps a lot, both in terms of endurance and being able to handle the last miles of a marathon.
4. **Any significant interruptions in your training.** I’m not talking about a flu that made you miss four or five days of training or your inability to complete a few long runs because life got in the way (even if it was your 20-miler you missed). I’m talking about things that prevented you from running for weeks during training like a serious injury or illness or major disruptive life event. Obviously, if you had such interruptions, you would want to think about a much more conservative time, or even freeing yourself from any time goals and simply focusing on finishing.
5. **If you’re naturally more inclined toward endurance or speed.** If you’re one of those people who can run a 3:11 marathon despite a 1:34 recent half-marathon, let us know so we don’t have to be as conservative with your time predictions.
6. **What race you’re running.** Also include information about whether the course is flat or hilly and the typical race day weather is. Many of us would give different race time predictions if you were running Shamrock or Chicago than we would if you were running Baltimore or Austin.
7. **Any stretch goals you have.** If you want to break three hours and you’re unsure if you can but you’re willing to take the risk of an implosion in the later miles, let us know. We can tell you if your goal is difficult but plausible or if it’s completely unrealistic.

Basically, these provide information about your current fitness level and factors such as the quality of your training, your experience level, and the race you’re doing in order to help us adjust the prediction of your marathon time as appropriate.

Meanwhile, here are some things that are much less useful. Feel free to include them if you want, but if I were reading your post to help you determine an appropriate marathon target time, most likely I will gloss over these things.

* **Your long run paces.** The purpose of long runs is not to test whether you are capable of achieving your marathon goal but to induce the physiological developments that will help you run your best on marathon day. We would have reason to be concerned if none of your long runs lasted more than 90 minutes or fourteen miles, but since these runs should be done at an easy pace for the most part, they are not a good assessment of your current fitness. While it is true that faster runners tend to run their long runs faster, running your long runs at X pace will not cause you to complete your marathon in Y time. In fact, runners who do their long runs faster than what their fitness dictates could end up running themselves down and shortchanging the development of their endurance. Similarly, not running your long runs faster than X pace does not mean you will fail to run your marathon in Y time.
* **The results of your Yasso 800s workout.** Similar reasoning—a runner than can do a marathon in three hours should be able to do ten 800 meter repeats in three minutes each, but being able to do ten 800 meter repeats in three minutes each does not necessarily mean the runner will complete the marathon in three hours, particularly if his endurance is lacking. This is a good workout, but as a marathon time predictor, it isn’t particularly useful. I would actually go as far as to say that paces in any workout, including tempo runs and easy runs, are not good assessments of current fitness for the same reasons. So yes, a half-marathon race time is a better predictor than a 21-mile long run.
* **Marathon pace segments in long runs.** Just because you were able to run twelve miles at your target marathon pace does not guarantee your ability to sustain it for another 14.2 miles. Meanwhile, marathon pace runs can fail for numerous reasons other than lack of fitness such as weather conditions or residual fatigue in your legs. I’ve personally failed marathon pace runs yet did not adjust my race goals on marathon day and still did fine. Marathon pace runs may be good for getting your body used to that pace, but your ability or inability to complete them usually doesn’t mean much for your race day performance.
* **How close to the actual marathon distance you ran during training.** I have run six BQs without ever running more than 20 or 21 miles during my long runs. And I know I’m not alone in that regard. Meanwhile, I know several people who have gone up to 24 or 25 miles and it still didn’t really help them. Actually, you will reach a point of diminishing returns the longer your long run is; for most runners, a 25-mile long run will not provide much more benefit than a 19-mile long run, especially if 25 miles takes much more than three hours. However the 25-miler will often require noticeably more recovery time. Generally, unless you can run a 5K in about 17:30 or faster, you don’t need to go more than 21 miles during any long run.
* **Your age and gender.** Age and gender can be a proxy for mileage and training. If a 28-year-old and a 58-year-old have the same half-marathon time, it is safe to assume the 58-year-old ran more miles and had higher quality training and thus will be better prepared and able to handle a more aggressive target time. Similarly, if a man and a woman have the same half-marathon time, it is safe to assume the woman ran more miles and had higher quality training. But once I know the crucial information from above, age and gender don’t really contribute any additional information. I generally ignore age and gender once I know recent race times, training, and experience level."

# Background

This race wasn't originally on my schedule.

However, race organizers reached out to me last minute - as well as several other runners around the area - and asked if we'd be interested in joining the elite field. They offered a travel stipend and prize money to the top-3 men's and women's finishers. Who am I to turn down such an offer and the possibility to win some dough? Plus, I always enjoy to race (famous last words) and mix it up with other talented athletes.

It would also be the third time in the past five editions that I've done this race. I first ran the Cajun Cup back in 2019 and placed second in 32:31 for my fastest 10k in more than 13 years. Then I went back in 2022 and placed fourth in 32:41. Needless to say, I have some familiarity with both the course and the Lafayette area.

# Pre-Race

I checked the weather throughout the week hoping to see favorable conditions.

Early on, it appeared as if we'd luck out, but then a storm system started brewing in the Gulf of Mexico - and with that came unseasonably oppressive conditions. The average weather from the past two times I did the race was 47°F with a 42°F dew point and 83% humidity. That's not bad for November in Louisiana. I'd say damn near ideal. So what about this year? Try 75°F with a 72°F dew point and 90% humidity. That's not ideal.

I ran through several permutations of how I'd attack the race in my mind the night before. Most of it depended on who'd toe the start line alongside me. If it was the entire elite field they had listed, I might have found it tough to finish top-3 since I didn't have much 10k specific training under my belt, so I figured I could go out hard, try to PR in the 5k since they have an official split, coast the next 2 miles and then push the final mile. Another option would be to tempo through 7k and hammer the final 3k. My last idea - and the one that won out - was to stay within striking distance of 5k and try to be as strong over the final 5k as I could.

# Race

As expected, three runners set a brisk pace from the start: I wasn't one of them.

They are quite familiar to me, though: Jarrett, a multiple time winner of this race, who has PRs ranging from 3:59.95 in the mile, 28:58 in the 10k and 2:13:48 in the marathon; Alex, who is a recent college grad that won the Corporate Classic 5k the week before; and Brett, who is local to Lafayette and has turned into a rival of sorts.

Another runner in the elite field named Carlos and I settled into our pace behind them. There are no turns in the first mile, so it really allows you to feel things out. I went through the first mile in 5:08, which is right around PR pace, and quickly ran through a mental checklist to make sure I wasn't too far ahead of my skis given the conditions. I decided to roll with it, mainly because I was in fourth or fifth place, among other things.

By the time we started meandering through local neighborhoods in the second and third mile, I was alone in fourth place with third place in my sights. I had split the second mile in 5:13 and the turn-filled third mile in 5:14, both of which didn't frazzle me since I knew the brutality of the fourth and fifth mile awaited me and I didn't want to bury myself before then. It was also right before I crossed the 5k split in 16:06 that we passed a local school with a videoboard that displayed the time of day and temperature. I groaned when I saw 77°F.

I made the right turn on the wind tunnel known as W. Congress St. and while it wasn't as bad as previous years, the headwind was still very present and persistent. I switched my data screen to power (mainly because the Stryd pod incorporates wind, too), put my head down and focused on getting through this stretch. It was around this juncture that I passed Brett into third place. I split the fourth mile in 5:19 and could feel it getting tougher. The fifth mile chimed through in 5:22 and I went into survival mode.

""Just get to the finish,"" I told myself. ""Don't get passed. Get paid.""

I picked it up as much as I could in the five-turn sixth mile and split 5:21.

I made the corner on Jefferson St., rounded the bend and saw the finish line.

A chance at an overall PR was long gone, but a course PR was still in play - or at least I thought. I pushed across the finish line in 32:38, which I figured was close, even though I couldn't remember exactly what I ran in 2019 or 2022. As it turns out, I middled the difference between both my placement and time in those races.

My splits were 16:06 and 16:32 - and while not great on the surface, the 16:32 was the fastest out of anybody on the course that day by six seconds. That was something I could hang my hat on about that day.

# Overall Thoughts

I needed this kind of race.

I needed this kind of race to feel what it was like to embrace the suck again.

I needed this kind of race to feel what it was like to embrace the suck again so I can get mentally stronger.

Who knew that my mental resolve would be tested just a few days later? I had a 3-2-1 mile tempo run on Tuesday in wet and windy conditions where the first set was a war of attrition. I was at least 10-15 seconds off pace and damn near bagged it, but told myself to get through the first mile of the second set. Well, that mile - and the rest of the miles - were right on pace, even though it felt tougher than needed.

Next up is the NOTC Turkey Day Race, which is the fifth oldest race in the U.S.

Other than that, we'll just keep on grinding and hope the weather eventually makes up its mind."

Personal History

7th marathon overall after starting running when I was 30, now 35. Prior PR was last year at the same race, 3:13. Felt I had plateaued, however, and hired an awesome online coach for the last 9 months to help me prepare. Thinking my BQ was 3:05, that's what I was training for. After realizing it got reset to 3:00 for 2026, that was more of a stretch goal. For what its worth, my Garmin race predictor had been telling me 3:00 was within range. I know I know, it doesn't mean anything.

Training

Located in Phoenix so the majority of training until the last couple months was indoor on the tread (1% incline) given local temps.  Ran 4-5x/ week, mixture of easy days, tempo, hills, regular cross and strength training with a 13-20 long run most weeks. Completed 2 20 milers in the last block and was hitting 40ish-50ish mpw most weeks, maxed at 60 mpw.  Overall ran \~1300 miles in 2024.

Pre-Race

In the days leading up I followed protocol: ate and drank all the carbs I could, got adequate sleep, stayed stretched out, couple short easy runs. Woke up at 3 AM on race day, had my bagel/banana/powerade with liquid IV, stretched. On my way to the race at \~3:55 am, I realized I had forgotten the gatorade and electrolytes that I always carry with me in a collapsable water bottle at the start of a race. I have no idea how some people can make it through the race on shots of water at the aid stations every 3 miles, but that is certainly not me.  Regardless, I was too far gone to do anything about it and at 4:04 am texted my wife: ""Fuck it, we're riding vibes."" Encouraged by the fact the start of the race is cold and insensible losses should be small, while also knowing my wife would be at mile 10 to pass me another bottle, I turned up the Meat Loaf and drove on.

Race

**Stovetop: OFF**

Came out of the gate cruising with the 3:05 pacer and felt great. The opening to the course really is amazing, running on a nice downhill through the desert at dark then watching the sun slowly come up on the city. Felt very comfortable, conversational. I have run the first 10-15 miles of this course many times during training, and other than a 1.5 mile climb around mile 5, the profile is very favorable.  The first 10 miles of this race go by in the blink of an eye and that was the case today. My splits showed I was average \~6:50.

**Stovetop: LOW**

After mile 10 the course flattens out or at least feels like it does in comparison.  Tried to settle into a groove and as the miles ticked by, kept hitting splits around 6:50. Sadly, my wife ran into some barriers, and given my increased pace, was not at our typical mile 10 pass off point, so I continued on without a water bottle. She would eventually find me at mile 15, however. After mile 16 or 17, visions of a BQ were definitely going through my head and excitement was rising. Unfortunately, my heart rate was also rising, and I either consciously or unconsciously tried not to pay attention to this fact, mostly because I still ""felt good.""

**Stovetop: MEDIUM**

Between mile 18 and 19, the sun was fully up, and while the temp was still realistically in the mid to high 60s, there is no hiding from the desert sun. The difference in how the temp felt between the first half and the second half was stark, and it clearly showed on the faces of most people running, including myself.

**Stovetop: HIGH**

At mile 19 reality set in and as I was breathing labored and my HR in the 190s. I abandoned the dreams of a BQ and pulled back my pace to 7:15, crunching the numbers and thinking that that would still allow for my primary goal.  Unfortunately, as has been alluded to throughout this, I was the frog and the water I was stewing in had been boiling for sometime without my realizing it. I was cooked.

**Stovetop: BOILING OVER**

The last 6.5 miles were a lesson in suffering like I had rarely felt before. I have told my wife before that the feeling of being gassed at mile 20 is the loneliest feeling the world, and that was certainly the case yesterday. I ran/walk the last of the race, occasionally making it a half mile before my body would give out. Hamstrings cramped, calfs cramped, neck cramped, fell more than once. Poured water on myself at the aid stations. Tried to summon that ""never surrender"" mentality that had dominated so much of my training. None of it mattered. After an excruciating hour, the race mercifully ended, with a final time of 3:12, which was easily the least encouraging PR I think anyone has ever set. I collapsed at the finish line and EMS carried me to the medical tent, gave me some electrolytes and ice while telling me I ""crushed it."" In reality, frog legs were on the menu and I was the appetizer.

**Summary:**

If you made it this far, thanks! After spending all year focusing and training for one date, having the goal seemingly so close, and then having everything fall apart around you, writing it was more an exercise in catharsis than anything else. Pretty down at the moment, no way around that. Have spent much of the past 24 hours wondering if some people (i.e. myself) are genetically pre-determined to be ""pretty good"" runners and not ""great"" runners, or if I just need to wait 15-20 years, until my BQ threshold catches up to my abilities. In the end, it's a fun, frustrating, agonizing and occasionally rewarding sport. Yesterday was a lesson in humility. We'll see what tomorrow is.

# Training

After missing a PR by 1 minute in September at the Erie Marathon, I wanted to find a good spring race to give it a go. I debated between Shamrock, Coast Guard, Newport News One City, and Tobacco Road. I chose Tobacco Road for a few reasons: it's popular with my local running groups, the gradual hills could be better for switching up the pain throughout the race, and the shaded course should be free from wind and sun.

This was a long training cycle that included a marathon run at party pace partway through, Disney in January, that I wanted to use as a good training run. I began training for that in October with speedwork on Wednesdays and mostly easy long runs on the weekends that culminated in 2, 20 milers, a few pace work long runs that got to 14 miles, and total weekly mileage that peaked at 53 miles. Having a great time at that race, averaging an 8:15 pace with very little effort, I was eager to recover smartly and pick up my mileage quickly but smartly. After struggling in previous training blocks with the long pace runs that peaked at 17 miles I wanted to focus on making those as good as possible. Fortunately, most went well, except for the last one that coincided with an icy weekend that moved me to the treadmill. Unfortunately, a headache on the run and general malaise with the treadmill made that an unsuccessful attempt. The rest of my training was OK, peaking at 61 miles. I had better strength training and plyometrics in the months leading up to race day, and a new pair of Saucony Endorphin Pros.

# Pre-race

It became clear about a week ahead of time that the perfect running weather our area has been having would not stick around for race day. Thunderstorms and warm, humid weather was in the forecast, and the race ended up switching to a 4 hour cutoff of the full and half because of the lightning rolling through. Race morning would be a muggy 67-69F, far warmer than I prefer. I added a sauna and some sweatshirt running in the 10 days leading up to race day to try to get some last minute heat conditioning in. I followed a solid carb loading plan and drove to the race expo before previewing the course on a 2 mile shakeout run the day before. I had a night of tossing and turning before an early morning wakeup and shuttle ride to the starting coral. Despite warnings to get there early, I was nearly alone when I arrived and thought that most runners had bailed because of the storms, but was glad once the crowds finally arrived.

# Race

As with too many races, the excitement of race morning sent me out about 20 seconds faster than planned, when marathon pace feels like an easy jog. I settled into goal pace around mile 3-5 after the course turned off the road and onto the packed gravel track. This race is T shaped, with about 21 miles on the top bar of the T, which is the rails-to-trail path. The path is mostly packed gravel, although \~6 miles is nicely paved. I stuck to my fuel plan throughout the race, although I knew that I was a bit more tired than ideal as the warm weather began to suck energy from me. The gentle hills were mostly ideal for the first 18 miles, when the final turnaround brings you back up a sandy, long climb back to the road, and this is where I most felt the heat and the poor early pacing catch up with me. I was clearly slowing down, but passing about as many people as were passing me, so I kept up the effort as well as I could. The final 3 miles were a struggle: I felt as if I were picking up the pace but ended up being much slower there than I had hoped. Seeing the finish line appear brought a welcome end to the race, despite the 3:15 on the clock. 

# Post-race

The incoming storm made the post-race area less of a celebration than normal, as folks tried to clear out. I grabbed a chocolate milk, banana, and shuffled as quickly as I could to the shuttle bus.

This is my third attempt at breaking a PR. I'm consoling myself with some temperature adjusted pace calculators, and see that the heat and humidity accounted for the time difference between what I wanted and what I saw. I know I'm improving as a runner, but I obviously do not see that being reflected in my finish times. After recovery, I'm going to focus on good speedwork through the summer to see if I can improve my 5K times, and do a few triathlons, which I find incredibly fun and rewarding. Adding in more plyometrics and trying to get the mileage up to 70 are the two additions I'd like to make for the next race. I will likely run Richmond in the Fall, the site of my last PR. They've got 3:10 and 3:00 pace groups, which I think will help tremendously. That and with a bit of luck in the weather I may get where I'm trying to go.

# Training

I (26F) chose LA as my first marathon since I live in SoCal and I didn't want the stress of traveling with my first race. I decided about a year ago after running the Disneyland Half that I was ready for the challenge. I ran that race in 1:59 without a serious training plan. I ran cross country in 2012 my freshman year of high school but didn't have any serious running training besides that and honestly didn't enjoy running then. I've been going to Orange Theory (OTF) for 6 years 3-5 times a week and only started to incorporate outside running regularly when I started training for the half marathon in October 2023 (by training, I did 5-9 mile runs on Sundays).

My training plan for the marathon started at the end of October where I slowly built up to 30 miles per week to roughly follow the Pfitz 18/55. I was a bit nervous to start this plan as the mileage was intimidating, but I thought it would adequately get me to my goal of sub 4. A few weeks after starting and being consistent with the sub 4 paces, I felt like 3:45 was within reach, but wasn't 100% sure I could pull it off. I decided to train at those paces and hold them if I could. I didn't follow the plan to a T as I still wanted to regularly attend OTF 3-4 times a week for strength and cross training. Weekly mileage was most important for me. I continued to go to OTF 3-4 times a week during training, but would subtract treadmill miles from outside miles (against some of the advice I read in this sub). This oftentimes meant I was running before going to an evening OTF class or only taking one rest day a week. I don't recommend doing this unless you are already pretty active. I would also try to align my treadmill paces with the type of run that was on the plan for that day. I live in a relatively flat area, so would throw in hills on at least one OTF treadmill block per week. Speaking of hills, I did try to incorporate hills on my longer runs, which I think was well worth it.

I followed Pfitz 18/55 92% according to plan, missing a few runs due to the life/the holidays (including the first of three 20 milers). I nailed all of the 3:45 marathon pace runs. This gave me confidence I could hold this come race day. However, closer to race day I started to get hesitant as I started experiencing some discomfort in my hip flexor and made the decision to skip my last 16 miler before my taper began. This resolved with stretching, ice, and a massage gun before race day. I did fall victim to terrible blisters that lasted over a week, which were resolved with new shoes that were size 9 instead of my usual 8

# Pre-race

Woke up at 3am and had my normal long-run breakfast, which was an iced espresso with a bit of cream and oatmeal with bananas, brown sugar, and nuts. Packed all of our gear and my husband and I left the house at 4am to find the parking garage we prepaid for weeks ago. We ended up driving around for over 45 minutes trying to find the lot, but we were unable to access it due to road closures, despite using Google Maps as the race planners recommended (anyone else have this issue??). We ended up paying for parking again as we knew we would miss the shuttles to Dodger Stadium if we continued to search for it. After making it on the shuttle and to the start, we waited in another super long line to use the restroom, only having to ditch it for me to pee in a bush. My husband wasn't able to go, so we planned for him to stop in the first couple of miles. We were also in the open corral, which was a bit of a mess and we couldn't find the 3:50 pace group we wanted to stick with for the first few miles. Even though pre-race was stressful, this sort of took my mind off of the nerves I had about expectations for this race. 

# Race

The race starts on a slight uphill, then it's pretty much straight downhill the first mile or so. We were sticking to the sides to just try and make it past the crowds. Right at mile 2, my husband had to stop to pee. I knew we would have to hustle to make up for the few minutes this stop took. On the downhills in this first part, we were hitting 7min paces, which were pretty fast for me, but I honestly felt great so we stuck with it. I was extremely nervous about the hills in the first 6 miles, so my plan was to take the uphills easy. In retrospect, the hills were not nearly as bad as I anticipated and the crowd support was great so it really took my mind off of the physical struggle. 

We started hitting the paces I knew that I needed to hit 3:45, but there was still so much of the race left that I didn't want to set myself up for disappointment in case something happened later on. My husband and I were taking it all in and chatting about how cool the city looked from this perspective, reading the signs, etc. At mile 11, he started to fall off a bit. He is a fast runner (can run a 5 minute mile) so I thought he would be able to stick with me. But he didn't follow a training plan for this race besides doing a few of the long runs with me. By mile 13, I realized I would have to pull off from him if I wanted to reach 3:45, so off I went. I was doubting myself in being able to mentally finish the race without him, but knew I could trust my training.

I continued feeling great physically and mentally. My sister called me and was updating me on my pace and I knew if I could hold my current 8:20ish pace I would meet 3:45. The miles felt like they were flying by, but it started to get a bit hot. I resorted to dumping water from the aid stations on my head. Passing by the finish around mile 19 and seeing the 3 hour folks finish really threw me for a loop. Towards mile 23, I was mentally in the trenches to say the least. I had been warned about the rolling hills in this section and they were sneaky, but honestly I expected worse. I was forcing myself to think positive thoughts and was trying my best to draw energy from the crowd. I knew I was close. My watch timer went off telling me it was time for another gel at 25, which was hard to get down, but I'm glad I took it. That last mile was the hardest of the race. My quads were on fire and I started to get stomach cramps but just kept picturing myself crossing that finish and trying to count down how many minutes I had left. I cried crossing the finish and immediately looked at my tracker to see that I just barely met my 3:45 goal and was elated!

Fueling plan was a Huma gel every 30 minutes and did my best to alternate water and electrolytes at every aid station.

# Post-race

Celebrated with my husband who finished a little over an hour after me and some friends with a meal at Chilis and some ice cream. I was and still am on cloud 9! I'm definitely the most sore I have ever been, but my feet feel great (thanks to Saucony Endorphin Pro 4s, chafe balm, and good socks).I have learned so much from this experience about running and my body. I am so thankful for this community and the advice that is shared in here. Besides the pre-race parking stress, I couldn't have asked for better conditions for my first marathon, the weather was gorgeous and the crowds really showed up for the city. During those last few miles, I didn't think I would do another marathon...but I think I've got the bug. I'd love to be able to BQ one day. Not sure what's next, but maybe a 10k or half plan to build up some speed. If anyone knows of any run clubs in the LA area, please share!

# Background

31M, have been running on and off most of my life, surprised myself a little with a 1:23:29 PB at the Buller Half Marathon in February this year, so decided to give a real training plan a go and try for sub 3 marathon. I am normally a footballer (soccer) so running always takes a back seat, but this winter I took a year off to train for this race in the hope of going sub-3. This was my second marathon and first time doing a structured training plan (albeit Runna app).

Current PRs before the day (according to Strava) are: 18:14 in the 5k, 39:15 in the 10k (acknowledge that could be faster, I just haven't done one), 1:23:29 HM, and 3:12:27 full marathon.

# Training

I did quite a bit of research after Buller HM in Feb and landed on the Runna app as the option that suited me the best for training. I couldn't find a person locally and as far as paying for something virtually, Runna was the right balance of price/engagement. I wouldn't use them again, but I think it was a great option for me at the time as I had very little experience with different types of runs, running plan and managing a training schedule. 

I chose a 16 week marathon plan which started mid-July. Typical 3 week build and a deload week in between peaking at around 74km 4 weeks out, something I have learned is actually pretty low now! Got lucky and had no injuries during the whole block, missing only 1 long run when I got the flu for 4-5 days. For some reason the app classified the Auckland Marathon as a moderate elevation race and so had me doing a hill repeat session almost every week, which, surprisingly, I have grown to love. Found the perfect hill where I live that was long enough and steep enough to withstand the longer 90s reps, such an amazing feeling doing 10-15 hill reps as the sun comes up looking out over the ocean - a great way to start the day.  

Highlights included:

* absolutely cruising through a HM at MP about 2 weeks out which included full walk through of pre-race morning plan.
* Discovering my local track for the interval sessions once a week.
* Of course, my new best friend the hill repeat session.

# Pre-Race

Flew up to Auckland with my partner on the Friday morning and headed straight to the Expo to collect my race pack, this was my first big event so was buzzing after the Expo experience, a lot more freebies than my local events. Spent Friday afternoon and Saturday relaxing and catching up with friends in Auckland, we were staying with some friends in Devonport \~5 mins walk from the start line, something I was very grateful for come race day. I had been so unbelievably nervous in the weeks leading up to this race out of desire to achieve my goal I was surprised to find I slept pretty well on Friday and Saturday nights. Sunday morning was 3:30am wake up for bagels and coffee before watching the PL and relaxing while trying to get the bowels going, a small warm up and walk down to start line around 5:15am. Special mention to my supportive partner who was by my side the whole way and came down with me for the start, didn't even need to do a bag drop this race thanks to her! Hugs with her and my mate who came down to see me off, last dust off of the nerves and down my pre-race gel and I was into the corral. 

# Race

6am gun to kick us off after the wheelies got away at 5;55am. It was an unusual layout at the start line so I ended up probably further forward than I would have otherwise chosen. Because of that my first km was a little slower as I let the 3 hour pack catch up to me. My goal was to stick with the two 3:00 pacers for the first \~25km and then reassess from there. For nutrition I had 5 Pure Nutrition 50g gels that I prefer over the 35g ones as I can get them down easier. 

Kms 1-12 Head down and focus on calming my nerves, slot in at the middle of the 3 hour pack and just try to enjoy it, introduced myself to the pacers and had a small chat, did a lot for my nerves and after that I relaxed a lot. 

Kms 13-21 The group got on to the motorway and down towards the iconic Auckland Harbour Bridge crossing in good time. We faced a serious headwind down this 5km fairly exposed section, the group really tightened up as we all huddled behind the two pacers breaking the wind for us. This section was particularly memorable as I was feeling really good and the experience of running in such a tight pack like that, paired with going over the bridge was pretty epic. Once over we hit downtown Auckland and the crowds began to appear a little more. See my partner at the 22k mark which gives me an awesome feeling! I was about to move away from the group at this point so she gets a great clip of me leading a big pack of runners.

Kms 22-38 This part of the race is really good for me, out towards the Eastern Bays, I make a move away from the 3 hour pack with a young guy doing his first marathon, we run some of my best kms as I'm feeling great and we're just chatting away about our experience so far. At the turnaround \~30km I realise why it had been such easy running and we head back towards town with a bit of a headwind . We join up with a couple of other guys and make a nice pack as we chew up the ks. 

Kms 38-40 Here the race kind of goes sideways for me, I lose the pack I have been running with at about 37 as I can't hold on and they are all still running really well, drop my pace to about 4:30 and start to hold on. Did some quick math to know that I was going to hit my sub-3 goal as long as I keep moving. The headwind really starts to hurt me and even the smallest hill feels like a mountain to overcome. Frantically gulp down my last gel in an attempt to get some life into me and just try to keep putting one foot in front of another. 

At my first marathon 2 years earlier I ran a similar-but-slightly-slower pace but was extremely under-prepared and under-experienced. During that race I fell apart at about 38kms and walked for 6 minutes as I ate the one gel I had with me that came free in my race pack. I thought a lot about that race during this section and gritted my teeth as I knew I was not stopping this time round.

Kms 41 - Finish: Just have to keep moving. Pump the arms. It will all be ok. Focus. Crowd really starts to pull me through this last section. The front 3 hour pacer catches up to me at this point and practically yells in my ear to keep moving. We were going to make it. My timing was slightly off as I ended up doing 42.6 but I still had enough time to go under 3hr. Feel the crowd rouse me for the last few hundred meters despite my legs screaming at me. I turn the corner onto the grass, look up and see the clock. 2:59:10. A wave of emotion hits me. You are going to make it. Andrew the 3 hour guy is right in front of me and waves me forward. Go get your time. Physically, I can barely feel anything at this point but emotionally, I feel everything. Overjoyed, relieved, grateful, immensely proud. I cross the finish line and don't really know what to do, can't stand. can't see. I just wobble over and lie in the shade. I lie there thinking about all the work I have put in, countless early mornings in the cold, clocking up those miles, its all added up to this. Elation. Not sure how long I lie there for. I chat to a nice lady for a few minutes who was running near me for some of the race, we swap times and congratulations, the conversation brings me slowly back to reality and I figure I need to get moving. 

# Post-race

I gingerly walk through the finishers area and sip on some electrolyte drink. See my partner and friends waving at me, can't even wave back, just smile. I move through and meet them out in the open, a big hug from my girlfriend and the tears come. More relief than anything, she knows how much it has meant to me this year. We head off and I buy some post-race Birkenstocks as I've lost one of my toenails and can't roam Auckland CBD barefoot. Breakfast at the ever-fantastic Amano in Britomart for a post race debrief. We spend the rest of the day relaxing and I have a much deserved nap. 

3 days on now and I am looking ahead to the Queenstown marathon in less than 2 weeks, pressure off for that one as I've hit my goal, so a chance for me to enjoy the run. Thinking about what's on the cards for me next, I know I could work on my finish and easily shave a couple more minutes off my time. But equally wondering if the HM distance is better for me for chasing times, and I could focus on doing a couple of Ultras next year. 

Thanks for reading! "

# Background

I'm 23F. I started running in summer of 2021 and have taken it up as a serious hobby over the years. I ran my most recent half-marathon PR of 01:47 in October 2023 and had zero racing strategy for that one and just full-sent it the last 6 miles. I trained for my first marathon in summer of 2024 and ran 03:49:00 after a mostly-terrific training block where I was on target for 03:30:00 but had a total crash-out a month out (I had RED-S). Took off running from December-January 2025 due to shin splints + recovery but got back to it in February!

# Training

I didn't want to commit to a true training block for this race due to lingering uncertainties around my shin splints and because I was not mentally ready to lock in that much. I also really like lifting and wanted to keep it up 5x a week, which meant my running training wasn't as optimal as it could've been,  but I was happy. This was a typical week:

| Day       | Workout                                              |
|:----------|-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Monday    | AM Lift + 4mi easy                                   |
| Tuesday   | AM Lift + 4mi easy                                   |
| Wednesday | 10–11mi with quality miles + PM Lift                 |
| Thursday  | AM Lift + 4mi easy / elliptical                      |
| Friday    | AM Lift + 4mi easy / 5–6mi tempo                     |
| Saturday  | 14–16mi long run workout / easy if Friday tempo      |
| Sunday    | 1 hr elliptical                                      |

My Wednesday runs were sometimes just steady + progression 5K at the end, or sometimes they were pyramid workouts, actual tempo runs in the middle, but whatever they were, they had some type of quality.

My LR workouts were my favorite. I didn't have a set structure to these either. All of them started with a mandatory 3mi WU and ended with a 1-2mi CD (as part of total mileage). They would often be 2mi@HM Pace repeats or 1mi@Bit Faster than HM Pace. Sometimes I would mix in HM Pace and Marathon pace, or 10K Pace for shorter intervals. Whatever the workout was, they were always intervals of some sort and I never did steady HM Pace for several miles. That wasn't intentional, but I guess it just wasn't what I was drawn to?

The flexibility of my 4x a week 4 mi easy runs was great. I never freaked out if I needed to change them to 45min ellipticals or if I had to shorten/skip them for whatever reason.

# Pre-Race

I took the bus to the neighboring town and then ran 1.5mi to the race start location as my warm-up shakeout. Unfortunately, I showed up 2 hours early, so I picked up my bib and then took a walk for an hour on the bike trail and tried to shake off some more anxiety. After milling around the parking lot another 20 minutes, I took off my sweatshirt and sweatpants and got ready to warm-up. I headed out for a 2mi warm-up, 1 mile slow and the other mile gradually speeding up and slowing down to my goal race effort. Things felt pretty normal. I still had more time to people watch after that haha. I lined up 10min from the scheduled start time and then I was off!

# Race

I envisioned being able to to give some detailed mile-by-mile breakdown when I wrote most of this report before my race, but alas, I was rather head-empty during the actual race.

True to what other people had told me, this course was relatively flat. There was only one noticeable hill and besides that, just a lot of smaller ups and downs. I was told that there was a “beautiful downhill” from Miles 11-12 by a friend and they must have remembered wrong because there was no such downhill. Luckily, I was familiar with about 1/3 of the course as it was on familiar bike trails, so that gave me some comfort.

I went into the race with the intention of racing by feel only. I ended up doing a mix of both, checking my watching about three times during the race to see if my perceived effort matched with my goal time. 

Originally, as a racing strategy, I had the following plan:

- Miles 0-4: Head out at 8:15-8:30 (comfortable work pace)

- Miles 4-9: Get a little quicker every mile down to 7:45

- Miles 9-13.1: Push each mile more and go all out near the end ranging from 7:30-7:00

As my times show, I ended up racing pretty steady instead. That’s not surprising considering that I am a consistent, steady runner and person in general. Not sure why I thought racing this race would be different haha, and it turned out not to be!

As I got to mile 4 and remembered my plan to pick up the pace, I checked in with myself about my RPE and decided to stay steady with the effort level I had and I’m glad I did. That is why I am very glad I train largely by feel, so that I could adjust my plan during the race based on how my body was feeling. 

The race itself wasn’t super big so the whole way, I was running by myself with maybe a person/two people in view running ahead. It was enough to have people to pass but not too many to feel super crowded. Not going to lie there was a 15 year old boy who was with me the first 10K and I was not about to be overtaken by him😂  I passed him at mile 7 and never looked back. 

Another thing that kept me going was “She’s flyin’!” that was uttered by one of the volunteers as I passed by the aid station at mile 9.

I was not feeling fabulous in the last 5K but I knew from race videos of pros that I had watched that that was okay and I should still be able to hold out, so I didn't freak out. It helped being able to know how to feel at different parts of the race so I knew I wasn't pushing too hard/too little. I looked down at my watch after I passed the 12.5 mile marker to see if I had made it under 1:45 and when I saw 1:36:xx I freaked out with joy and that was the last push I needed to get over the finish.

# Post-Race

So proud of this result! This was my first race where I went in with the intention of being serious about pushing my pace and giving it my all. I knew I could get the sub-1:45 if I didn't give up, as I had gotten a 1:44 on my flat training run a couple weeks before. And I was shocked that I rolled in under 1:40, too! This training block was DEFINITELY not everything I envisioned (had to juggle illness, school and job-interviewing stress) but I got my workouts in and I did it! After my marathon debacle, I felt like I lost confidence in my ability to run fast, but this block and race showed me that I still have it and I WILL achieve a goal so long as I tell myself I will. It was also great to see that I don't have to be on some big official plan to reach my goals and I can make running work for me. Now....onto my sub-22:00 5K in a couple weeks! Not as attached to that goal as this was my big one, but it'd be another thing off my list!"

### Training
This was my second marathon. The first was in October last year and went super well; I targeted 3:45, used Pfitz 18/55 for training, and while it was demanding I finished in 3:37 and (as I now know) in relatively good shape.

This time around I wanted to beat 3:30 and repeated Pfitz 18/55 but with faster pace. Training went well overall, no major injuries, and I mostly hit the workout paces OK (not too good at the VO2 Max sessions but better than last time).

### Pre-race
Got to Manchester Saturday afternoon, didn’t get to run at all though Pfitz schedules a 4 mile recovery run saying it is mainly there to keep you from fretting. Difficult to carb load when travelling but I did my best with a big bowl of cereal for breakfast followed by a bacon roll later, packed lunch with chunky cheese sandwiches and fresh fruit, then I consumed a mid-afternoon Ploughmans with a fruit smoothie and in the evening, a delicious goats cheese flatbread. I also drank loads of water, not sure exactly how much but several pints during the day. I think this did help as I was well hydrated before the race.

Set the alarm for 5:30am not that I needed to; didn’t sleep brilliantly. Cup of tea and sourdough roll early (Pfitz suggests eating 3-4 hours before running), more water. Then I headed for the start on the first tram from my hotel at about 6:25; no reason to be so early except that I didn’t have anything else to do! Always enjoy chatting with other runners and their supporters.

My first marathon had fewer than 1000 runners, this one claimed 36,000 though I am sure the actual number was a bit less. All a bit different though. Arrived Old Trafford tram stop, 10 minute walk to the start area. Dropped my bag at around 8:00am and was a little cold in my club vest, did some half-hearted short warm-up runs and took advantage of the portaloos. This was a success actually, the benefit of the early start meant that I had plenty of time to get ready as it were and had zero GI issues during the race.

I was in bronze wave which was the fifth to start after Elite, White, Red and Blue. Each wave had I gather up to 1800 runners which is biggish and I found myself towards the back of the wave for some reason. This didn’t matter as such, but the 3:30 pacers were towards the front and it wasn’t possible therefore to start with them. More on this later.

### Race
Off we go and I am trying to go no faster then a 7:45 pace (all my figures are in miles) and no slower than 8:00. Some congestion but it went fairly well and the miles started ticking by. Took a gel at the start and another 4 miles in. Skipped the first water station, grabbed a bottle at the second, but found drinking quite hard while running, I have learned that I can’t take a big gulp as it can easily turn into a coughing fit. Did my best; at least with the bottles you can carry them for a bit and take occasional sips.

After maybe 6 miles (can’t remember exactly), I catch up with a 3:30 pacer (there were two) and had a chat. Now, I knew from my Garmin that I was on target for sub-3:30 but of course having started at the back of the wave the pacers were a little in front. It was tricky though; the guy said he was currently running ahead of pace because he had a bathroom break and was now catching up with the other pacer. So I didn’t want to keep pace with him as it would be too fast. Off he went into the distance.

At the half-way point I finally caught up with the other 3:30 pacer. This was odd because he was now quite a way behind first guy. I asked about this and he said his fellow pacer was more than a minute ahead of time. He also said he was a bit ahead, and his plan was to to slow down at 26 miles and then wave people past to get their time. I concluded that my best strategy was to try and stay ahead of him.

I was more fatigued at this point than I was when half-way in October but there were two good reasons for that. One was that my pace was about 7:54/mile versus 8:16 or so in October. The other was the heat; we were running in up to 20 degrees Celsius and bright sunshine whereas October was overcast with occasional light rain and much cooler (I don’t know the exact temperature). 

Another thought: for this event I trained in the cool of the winter and then ran in relatively warm conditions; where last time I trained in the heat of the summer and then ran in relatively cool conditions – an easier transition!

Anyway I was keen to get to 20 miles as Pfitz calls 13-20 the “no-mans land of the marathon” when you can easily lose pace. Kept the pace fairly well and was helped by the pacer because if he appeared beside me I knew I had to run faster!

Got to 20 miles and by this time I was seriously fatigued. I took my first carb-packed SIS beta fuel at this point and told myself it would help me to keep going. 

The last 6 miles were tough. I can’t say I hit the wall; I lost a little pace but it wasn’t terrible – my slowest mile according to Garmin was mile 24 at 8:04 pace. Heat was getting to me, really needed water at the last drink station. It was difficult to drink enough, but poured the rest over my head, great idea and I should have done this before.

It is hard to describe the mental battle that was taking place in those last miles. I told myself to just keep running even though I no longer had the energy for it. I told myself to run fast so that the ordeal would be over quicker. I thought of my family and friends tracking me and did not want to disappoint them. And again, if the 3:30 pacer appeared, I did my best to run faster (and in the end, I did finish ahead of him, but a few seconds behind the other 3:30 pacer).

The crowd at Manchester was fantastic and it was great to hear all the shouts of encouragement including my name from time to time (name were shown on the bibs). I also passed plenty of runners walking and told myself that I would not do that. Just one parkrun to go. Just two miles to go. Then there is a sign that says you are on the final straight, most welcome but I did not have it in me to up the pace. Kept running, tried to smile for the camera, crossed the line, and then there was a weird moment: is it really OK to slow down now? 

I was pretty sure that I had beaten 3:30 but did not get the exact time until later (not carrying a phone). 3:27:46, a pb by over 9 minutes and a GFA for London next year by over 24 minutes (V65 M).

### Post-race
Finishing a marathon can be anti-climactic. I felt good about my time but also very fatigued, and the first thing you do after finishing at a big event like this is quite a lot of walking, since the organisers have to keep the finish area clear. So picked up a bottle of water (good thinking!), walked to medal area, picked up tasty non-alcoholic tin of beer (chilled! Nice), walked to picked up bag, quite a long way with several lorries for each start wave, then walked to T-shirt area, then you come out of the finish area and eventually to a sign that says Piccadilly Station 14 mins walk, my hotel was near there so I just plodded on, eventually sitting down to a lovely latish lunch there with a cold beer and some fellow finishers.

I can’t really fault the organization, the start was smooth and on time, the facilities were good, the medal is nice, all very professional, but there is inevitably a lot of standing around at the start and walking at the end.

The pacers worked hard but were not ideal for me. I would prefer that they ran closer together and with even splits, though they did finish pretty much on the button.

While I was happy with my time it was actually slower than the 3:19 VDOT predicted from my best half in February; I think this shows the impact of the heat as my effort was as great or greater.

Despite piling on the suncream I caught the sun in a few spots, my advice if you are running this summer is don’t forget the back of your legs and all round your arms as that is where I went wrong. Wore a cap which I do think helped.

Finally, kudos to the Pfitz plan and book which got me through again without any calamities, such a great resource.

Well, second marathon didn't go quite as planned, and only marginally better than my first.

Some back story as I attempt to hone in on what my kryptonite is with the marathon distance: I was the kid with a lot of ""potential"" in school track, didn't push myself too much and never won races or made varsity, and continued running recreationally all through my 20s. Did a half at 23 just to ""see if I could"" and came in at 1:49:XX, and I was proud of myself (didn't have optimal training and honestly can't remember fueling at all).

I revisited the half at 28, PR'd, and put my name in the lottery for the Big Sur International Marathon. I got in and ran it in 2024 with a goal of going sub-4 (relatively ambitious for me on my first marathon, and on that course, I thought), and completed it in 3:58:XX. I was placed in corral A and was unable to find the 4-hour pacer as they were in corral B, so I started off a bit hot, and struggled with nutrition, overcompensating at mile 16 and fighting nausea from miles 17-finish. I wanted to feel that sense of accomplishment when I crossed the finish line, but I just felt like I'd learned a big lesson about fueling properly.

I did two more halves in the last 5 months with a PR of 1:38:XX. That was 6 weeks before LA, and I planned it that way, knowing I might be compromising my dream PR at LA; I would have trained differently for the full if that half weren't important to me. I was able to get a 20-miler in before and after the half, but I prioritized mileage (maxed out at 48mpw) over speed workouts (something I would do differently next time, but again, other factors lead me to this decision). I practiced nutrition as I knew this was an area that I struggled with, and had a rough first 20-miler, but a perfect 21-miler, so I felt good to go for LA. I felt pretty confident about a sub 3:40, and dreamed of a sub 3:30 or even BQ (sub 3:25).

The morning of the LA race was a shitshow. I don't know who designed the corral placement, but I was elbowing my way through the open corral bottleneck to get to my seeded corral. I made it with one minute to spare and had my first gel about 25 minutes before take-off. Again, I went out a bit hot, trying not to get stuck behind the people holding the giant letters (honestly, very annoying that they don't discard them before crossing the start line).

The first \~11 miles or so felt pretty good, fueling at miles 4 and 9. As I approached the half mark, my quads were noticeably fatigued, more so than any other race/workout I've done before. I later learned that the race is net downhill, which could explain the load on the quads.

This is where I struggle with understanding what my body needs, and what language to use to find others who've struggled with, and overcome, this issue: at the half mark, I considered taking another gel, but my stomach can be very sensitive at higher (for me) speeds. I'm someone who hardly pukes--my body does everything in its power to hold food in, at the expense of feeling extremely nauseous for miles on end. Between miles 13-19, I knew I *should* be fueling, according to experts and every fuel guide out there, but I also knew that I'd end up with nonstop nausea for the duration of the race, like I had at BSIM, if I'd tried. When I pushed too fast, I felt my breathing begin to labor, and I'd back off a bit. Because I was fighting this feeling between 14-18, I thought it better to avoid fueling. I took tiny sips of Electrolit at nearly every aid station until mile \~19, and eventually forced another gel down at mile 20. At this point, my pace had slowed (screenshots for your analysis), so it was marginally easier to get nutrition down than if I were at my goal race pace of \~8:15. I don't remember much from miles 21-25 besides walking every time I felt nauseated, taking cups of water from every non-aid support on the course, and texting my friend, ""Man this sucks."" Said friend jumped in for a short while to pace me during the last mile, and was surprised that I was still able to hold a conversation. It was everything I could do to distract myself from needing to vomit.

And then, it happened. \~100 meters from the finish line, my vision blurred and I couldn't hold it anymore. I stopped, hands on my knees, and gave in to the purge (in front of hundreds of supporters, cheering on their loved ones, mind you)--except there was basically nothing to come up. I paused for a moment, looked up at the security person in front of me, shrugged, and ran for the finish line.

I came in at 3:48:21, nearly a 10-minute PR and my C goal, but my bigger goal was to feel good after the race. Friends and I have debated whether that's really even possible, and I guess what I mean by ""good"" is to feel like I had a good race, I paced myself well, and I nailed my nutrition. I don't feel like I did any of that, and never had the smiling-crying moment post-finish line (at this race, or my previous marathon). LAM pretty consistently mirrored BSIM (splits for both included), but with 1000ft less elevation gain, so the times seem fairly proportional based on that alone.

LAM pros and cons, for posterity:  
Pros:  
\- great crowds, so much energy and support and additional aid (can't count how many people I saw handing out orange slices in the last \~7 miles)  
\- solid finisher snacks (god those potato chips were worth their weight in gold, even with a stomach ache)  
\- this just comes with the territory, but generally great weather (though it was decently hot on the Westside, running weather-wise)

Cons:  
\- loud preaching the first \~5 miles and last \~1 mile, I wanted to throw my water at them  
\- shirt is TERRIBLE, it fits like a potato sack??? who approved this?  
\- again, the start was absolutely bonkers and I got there at 5:30am  
\- finish at Century City is disappointing compared to Santa Monica Pier, even if it's a questionable time to be swimming in the ocean (post-fires)

My quads were absolutely shredded in a way I haven't experienced in previous races, while my calves felt relatively fine? Anyway, overall I'm left with nightmares about the out-and-back along Sepulveda/Wilshire/Federal/San Vicente (so much support, but was mentally a ghost town), and no desire to run another marathon (which quickly subsided after BSIM). If anyone has overcome these nutrition challenges, I would LOVE to know what's worked for you. I have half a mind to begin recreationally running unofficial marathons at slower paces just to practice nutrition until I get the gall to sign up for another one. In the meantime, I think 13.1 is my race.

Apologies for the loads of negativity on this one--I also wound up sick on Tuesday and am still in bed moving through the congestion, so it's been a triple-whammy of a last week. Running has my heart and I'm excited to feel 100% and get back out on my local roads and trails just to have a good time (and eat yummy snacks).

# Training

Before signing up for this race, I had been an on-again, off-again runner for three years. In 2023, I ran the Cheltenham Half in 1:41 after a three month, entirely freestyled, unstructured training plan that essentially consisted of running whenever I fancied. Since that, my running was the odd 10k in what you might call ""zone 3"" - AKA as fast I could maintain for the distance.

I started running Parkruns with in summer 2024 and my love of running was truly ignited. I built up to 30-40km per week, and got my 5k time down from 23 to 20 mins by around September. At this point, one of my friends ran a marathon, and I decided it was time to face it myself.

I signed up for this marathon in October - a good five/six months in advance. My training started with five weeks or so on a Runna plan, before I decided it was too expensive and that I knew enough to design my own plan instead and save the money.

An important piece of context is that I have always, always, always hated going to the gym. One of the reasons I started running was because it seemed like a form of exercise where I could be competitive, and not be penalised because of my, \*ahem\*, slight build. Rather, I would have an advantage since I wouldn't be lugging extra weight around!

I have also never historically struggled with injury, and, despite the overwhelming advice I was seeing online, convinced myself that I could get away without strength training. You can probably see where this is going by now.

Throughout the block, I had various niggles - shin splints, ankle pain, hip tightness - all of which I managed. I felt comfortable that they were not anything serious, and all faded away in turn. This probably contributed further to my overconfidence.

After four months of training well, gradually building up to c. 60km/week by early February, I raced a half marathon in Cardiff as a tune up race. I set out at my 3:15 marathon goal pace, and felt so good after 15km that I sped right up and finished in just over 1:31. In hindsight, that day was probably when I peaked.

A week or two later, I started feeling a rubbing and clicking sensation in my right knee during easy runs. The next day, I had a bit of grief when walking down the office staircase. I thought nothing of it.

Then, I headed out on a hill sprint session. SNAP!

My knee was in serious pain. I hobbled home and started googling, before self-diagnosing with ITBS. Dang.

It was three weeks until race day, and I quickly realised that I was in serious danger of DNSing. I did my best to rest and rehabilitate, before trying my luck with some run-walk, easy jogs about a week before race day to see how it felt. The pain was there, but it was mild. The rest of the week, I vacillated back and forth between racing or pulling out.

Come race weekend, the weather was so stunning, I decided to travel to the race, rationalising that I could always just have a nice weekend in the South of Wales if I couldn't run. Before I knew it, I was at the start line.

# Pre-race

I had the Reddit-recommended 6am-bagel-with-peanut-butter-and-banana breakfast. I then realised that I had forgotten the lid / sealer thingy for my hydration bladder, which I had already filled with an electrolyte/maltodextrin combination and was planning to sip during the race. After a few minutes of panic, I decided to try and ""close"" the bladder using safety pins that had arrived in my race pack. This... did not work.

I then made my way to the start line.

# Race

I had a long time to wait in the corral, since there was a fifteen minute delay due to traffic congestion. I knew I wanted to go with a pace group, and there was a 3:15 pacer standing there, tempting me. 3:15 was my goal pace, but I had reservations about going slower to help manage the knee pain. Eventually, I decided to go with 3:15.

Almost immediately after the gun, the knee pain made itself known. It was mild, and I knew that I could deal with this if it did not get any worse. A big if.

Well, for the first 21k, the knee was not my biggest problem. My hydration bladder was leaking constantly down my back and onto my race shorts. This was no big deal until it started evaporating in the Welsh sunshine, leaving a sticky, salty residue on my legs back and shorts. My legs were adhering to my shorts, and it was far from comfortable to unstick them every few kilometers. At least it kept my mind off my knee, and I was feeling comfortable. The pace *felt* OK. My heart rate, according to my Garmin at least, disagreed, and I was hovering around 190bpm. My max is 205, and I would consider 190 fairly sustainable, but not for an entire marathon. I decided that my watch was probably wrong and I should just carry on. Probably unwise.

The 25k mark was the turnaround point, both figuratively and literally. As I went round the 180 degree turn, my knee became fed up of not being the centre of attention, and sent me a massive jolt of pain. At this point, I was literally as far away from the start/finish line, where my bag was dropped, as could be. I would need to get back anyway, so I was pretty motivated to do it as part of the race, rather than trying to find a taxi or bus in rural Wales on a Sunday.

I hobbled back the last 17k to the finish. Some walking, some jogging - a lot of pain. Definitely unwise. Definitely uncomfortable.

When I eventually crossed the finish line in 3:35, it was not the heroic sprint over the finish I had dreamt about. It felt awful. I felt like a fool.

# Post-race

Reflecting a few days later, there is some pride in the emotional mixture. I am pleased to have finished my first marathon, and have definitely learnt a lot about strength training, managing injury, preparing properly, and respecting the marathon.

The frustrating thing is that I had been warned about all of these things. From the good people of r/AdvancedRunning, to name one source. But I had let my arrogance convince myself that I knew better, that I could get away without strength training, that I could run a 3:15 first marathon with a knee injury after three weeks of no running.

I guess sometimes, you need to make mistakes for yourself.

**Overall summary:** This course is INSANELY hilly, and was extremely tough for my 2nd marathon. In the end I was very proud to have finished at all, and I can look back on it fondly now, but I would not recommend this race to any beginner/intermediate runner who has not significantly trained on hills. However, It was an absolutely stunningly gorgeous running route around the historic Dingle Peninsula, weather was great, the organization was decent, lots of music and incredible local support along the way, and a very unique running experience. If you don’t care at all about finishing in a certain time, and just want to see beautiful views and have a great experience, I would recommend probably doing the Half Marathon and not the Full (after the ½ finish, the route is mostly away from the coast and onto the interior, so you can get everything you want out of the ½ in my opinion).

**Background**

Male, 31, 6'1"", 165lbs

I played various sports unseriously as a kid, I was largely inactive during my college years and gained a lot of weight (up to 230lbs), then got into running around 2020 and lost 60+ lbs. Have been marathon training seriously for 2-3 years now.

My wife and I hired a remote trainer based in Brazil to develop specific running plans and strength workouts, and we have consulted a nutritionist on and off for several years to ensure we are eating well with our primarily vegetarian diet (wife is vegetarian, I’m not).

Run History:

- 1st Half Marathon – 2022 Miami Beach. Finishing time: approx 2:34
	I was very proud to have finished my 1st half nonstop with a decent time. Weather was perfect, a little humid but cool, and a very flat course along the Miami Beach coastline. Training/prep was mostly in Miami where we were living at the time, so the weather and elevation mirrored the course on race day.

- 1st Marathon – 2023 Rio De Janeiro. Finishing Time – approx 4:58
	Gorgeous marathon!! I ran my 1st Marathon alongside my wife (even though she’s a bit faster than me) for support which helped a ton, we only took 2 or 3 very short walking breaks, the weather was cool if not a little sunny on the back half, and elevation was very flat along the coastline of Rio. Absolutely stunning views of the city, ocean, mountains, and famous Ipanema and Copacabana beaches. We came just under our target of 5 hours so I was extremely pleased with how it went. Would highly recommend this race!

	This course was extremely hilly so I was very surprised to break my PR. I felt great about my consistent training leading up to it and knew it was an important benchmark in preparing for Dingle. I moved to Atlanta so the steep elevation there certainly helped me prepare properly for the hills in NC and upcoming marathon in Ireland.

**Training**

After my 1st marathon in 2023, I took around 3-4 months “off”, which included low mileage of around 60-90 kms/month. During this time I focused mostly on regular short-medium distance runs 3-4x/wk plus focusing on strength training to build muscle for the upcoming marathon training cycle

As for the actual marathon training plan… with the help of my running coach, I followed a roughly 4-5 month plan where my mileage started ramping up moderately from 90km/month to approx 150kms for the last 3 months. Longest runs were 28-32 kms toward the end. My weekly runs were a mix of long distance moderate pace, short distance easy pace, 1-2 H.I.I.T runs to increase speed, and 1-2 strength training days/wk (although I will admit to largely having slacked off this past year with my gym workouts, something I regret a little). I do not consider myself fast whatsoever, and I really hated the H.I.I.T runs, but I know they helped me in the long run. (no pun intended lol)

___________________________________________

**Pre-race**

1-2 week taper: of reducing volume and intensity, but still doing short/medium distances on the hills around Atlanta to keep my legs strong.

Significantly reduced alcohol consumption for 2-3 months prior to race day (Irish Guinness at the finish kept me motivated lol)

3 days before – We flew in to Ireland from ATL. The flight was an overnight so I took a melatonin to ensure I slept, which I did, but it was pretty tough and uncomfortable sleeping on the plane. We arrived into Dublin in the early morning and drove 4 hours to Dingle which was also pretty rough. 

2 Days before – once we arrived at our adorable Bed and Breakfast, we could finally relax. We spent the day sightseeing around the Dingle Peninsula. Mostly driving, some walking around town, and a very brief hike up Dunmoore Head. I also held a baby lamb lol. I was still adjusting my sleep schedule because of the 5 hour time change, so once again a melatonin helped me ensure I went to bed earlier than my body wanted to.

1 Day before – went to bed without the help of melatonin (didn’t want lingering affects on my body during race day), had a nice light hearty Irish breakfast provided by our amazing hosts at the BnB as well as an entire pizza the night before to carb load for race day.

___________________________________________

**Race**

Race start: 9am (later than I would have ideally wanted because the sun was already up) Although the weather was a cool 60 degrees f, there wasn't a single cloud in the sky so the direct sunlight honestly made it feel closer to mid 70s, especially once I was 1-2 hours in to the race.

1-21 km

I started off strong, despite some pretty big uphills around 10-17 kms that took us from sea level along the Dingle Harbor and way up into the cliffs. I ran the first ½ non stop at a pace that felt great for me. I consider myself slow but kept a  good pace for what I expected to run. 

21-30 km

Despite this section being overall downhill, the compounding incline from the previous mileage was starting to wear me down a lot. My wife, who is faster than me, passed me by at the beginning, but I caught up with her around 22 km. We both wanted to give up, having just passed the finish line for the Half Marathon, but we persevered and stayed together until the end. What followed was a loooot of walking interspersed with short jogs here and there to ensure we finished under the 6 hour time limit. Local Irish supporters really made this race and helped encourage us! We saw many musicians: traditonal accordion, bodhran, percussion, and a guitarist singing Oasis. At 2 different parts there was a homeowner spraying us with water from there hose which gave us an energy boost. Since our pacing went completely out the window, we started stretching our energy gel consumption to make sure we still had some left deep into the end of the route. Also a fellow runner/saint gave us some advil gel for our calves which saved our life! Along with a banana to avoid cramping, and some extra sunscreen from an aid station, all which helped immensely.

34 Km. “The Killer Hill”

I had studied the elevation before hand. My trainer gave us instructions on how to pace ourselves. I read the race reports from other Redditors. But nothing could have possibly prepared me for this gargantuan incline. I still cannot believe that anyone has ever run this entire route non stop, let alone this giant hill. A friendly DJ ensured us that after the incline it was all downhill to the finish, so we knew there was a light at the end of the tunnel. Our legs almost physically gave out multiple times but we persevered!

37 Km – End

I was very happy to have found some energy deep inside myself to actually get back to verrry slow jogs during the downhill finish! At this point we both knew that we would complete it, and that we would make it in under the 6 hour limit, and that a nice Guinness and Burger were waiting for me in Dingle Town. As we neared the downtown finish line, the local support grew, and we saw other finishers cheering us on with their medals. My wife and I finished hand in hand across the finish line just as we did in Rio De Janeiro, and were completely exhausted but very proud to have completed the race. We used the cold Dingle Harbor water as an ice bath to dip our legs into, and collapsed happily knowing we had done it!

___________________________________________

**Post Race**

Regretfully we had forgotten to mark where we parked our car, so we got slightly lost on our way back to finding our vehicle and accidentally went the wrong way up a large hill! But then we found it and had all of our post race stuff ready to go: compression socks, electrolytes, water, change of clothes, etc. We then headed to the nearest pub and enjoyed a victory beer/Irish Coffee, a burger, and watched a little of the Ireland/England soccer match (which didn’t end well for Ireland lol). 

I had originally planned to drive back to the BnB, nap, and rally back in Dingle that night at the pubs with live music and the whole nine yards, but we were simply far to exhausted to drive back through the tiny winding Conor Pass road, and decided to just recover back at the BnB that night.

___________________________________________

**Closing thoughts:** 

I absolutely had the time of my life, and this race was full of emotion. If the Rio De Janeiro marathon the previous year was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, the Dingle Marathon was 100x harder. I don’t regret signing up for it, but looking back, I would have chosen a much easier, flatter course for my 2nd marathon ever, and I would not recommend other beginner marathoners do this race unless they have very strong mental fortitude and are absolute masochists lol. Still, I had fun, and the ensuing week long trip around southern Ireland was incredible. I enjoyed every minute of our travels to Dingle, Killarney National Park, Inchigeelagh (my family heritage homeland), Cobh, and Dublin."
1jf8te1,2025-03-19 21:48:33+00:00,lordbyron49,,Marathon_Training,/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1jf8te1/barcelona_marató/,Barcelona Marató!,"Here is a report of my first ever Marathon, which I ran on Sunday in Barcelona.

I'm a 44 year old Swedish male. After 2.5 years of real running (40-50k or 25-30 miles weekly) and two half marathons (1:38 and 1:28) it was time for my first full marathon. Could I do it in sub 3 hours? With this base of running and a 12 week structured marathon program with 70-80k (45-50 miles) weekly running, this is how it went:

On race day conditions were ideal with temp at 7-10C and sunny. Flat course and beautiful city. Brand new, mint green Vaporfly 3:s. 27000 registered runners. The start was at 8:30 and there was a 3h pacer group that I decided to go with. Almost immediately they set off at a pretty fast pace. 4:08 for the first km. Then a blazing 4:06 for the next. I was able to keep up without too much trouble at that stage but I didn't like my chances for later in the race if I kept going at that pace so around there I decided I had to let them go and keep my own pace. 

After that a bunch of uneventful kilometers passed by. I took gels at kms 7 and 14. Running felt nice and smooth but I was a touch slow. Perhaps 4:17 pace. Then at 15k a second 3h pacer group caught up with me. At that point the second pacer group had a perfect 4:15 pace so I decided to stick with them for a while. I knew however that they had started a bit later than me so if I stuck with them all the way there was no guarantee I would make it below 3h since they were tracking a different starting time. That meant that at some point I would have to break away from them and run faster. 

At the half way point I took another gel and felt on top of the world. Really great feeling. I started thinking about picking up the pace at 25k. Then once we reached 25k I thought that ok another 17k is still a pretty long distance. It might be wiser to wait until 28k. 

Then once we hit 28k I had started getting significantly more tired and it turned out to be rather tough to latch on to a faster pace. I took a gel. Several times I thought I was running faster, but then turned out not to. At 32k I had not gained anything and was even a little behind schedule. At that point I despaired a bit because I was very tired, but still had 10k to go. This was mentally tough and I got some thoughts about perhaps not making it.

But then at 33-34k I finally did click into a slightly faster pace. 4:13 or something like that, which felt tough but stable so that gave some confidence. At least for a while.

Then at 37k a deeper wave of tiredness hit and I felt again like perhaps I was not going to make it after all. A voice started telling me it was not going to work and I should slow down. If that voice grew stronger I knew I was going to buckle. I also got nauseous and started worrying I was going to vomit. Might have been the gel at 35k which was a bit nasty. Or general tiredness. Hard to know. 

Luckily, the nausea did ease up eventually. Kilometers 37 to 39 went by in a bit of a haze and I actually thought my pace had dropped, but then to my relief when I checked my watch I could see I had not actually dropped the pace much. By that stage I knew then that I should at least be approximately on track, but at the same time was in no shape to do the math and figure out exactly what the margins were. Or if they were positive or negative. 

Then once I saw the 40k sign it was as if something let go. A huge wave of relief. I decided I had about a mile to go (small little lie) and decided to run it like it was the last mile repeat of a hard interval session. Something I had done many times in training and knew I could do. I picked up the pace and was able to kick the last 2k at about 4:05 pace. Weirdly, that faster pace actually made the last bit feel easier somehow. Was it the injection of adrenaline? The change in gait? Don't know, but it was pretty exhilarating. The crowd cheering helped too. Then I saw my wife and the last few 100m I could see the finish and that I was clearly going to make it so I just slowed down a little again and allowed myself to cruise over the finish line.

Time 2:59:07!!

1 minute later I was flat on the grass. 2 minutes later I tried to walk over to meet my wife and by then I could hardly walk. Weird how the body works. So tired, so happy. What a great combo!

I walked back to the hotel and spent the rest of the day there with my wife snacking and watching a movie. Woke up the day after with next level DOMS in my quads that got even worse the day after that. BIG trouble walking down stairs or sitting down / getting up. Sore arms and calves too. Today, three days after the race there is still a bunch of lingering soreness, but much better and walking just fine. 

Trying to figure out what's next.

ps. Sorry for the long post guys, but it was such an experience and I just really wanted to write all this down. Thanks for making it all the way if you are still here!"

# Background

I was a D1 Rower in college and had only ran casually for cross-training. In May of 2021, a shoulder injury prematurely ended my rowing career, so I decided to focus more on running and aimed for a goal of running a Boston Qualifier at the Philadelphia Marathon. Two weeks before the marathon, my right lung spontaneously collapsed and put me in the hospital for two weeks. After months of recovery, I began ramping up my training to try again at Philly in 2022  where I ran a 2:47:45 (Race Report: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/z10fh5/philadelphia\_marathon\_collapsed\_lung\_redemption/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/z10fh5/philadelphia_marathon_collapsed_lung_redemption/) ). After battling on-and-off injuries for a year and missing the registration for the Boston Marathon due to work travel, I decided to give it another shot at the Delaware Running Festival Marathon in April 2024 where I ran 2:35:32 using Pfitz 18/70 and finished 2nd Overall (Race Report: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cbj6nq/delaware\_marathon\_running\_festival\_a\_podium\_finish/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cbj6nq/delaware_marathon_running_festival_a_podium_finish/) ). I was injured and sick for 4-6 weeks out of the 18-week plan which is where this 13-minute PR shocked me the most. Backtrack to the Fall of 2023, I had found out that my time qualifier from Philadelphia (2:48) was still valid when applying for a guaranteed entry into the Chicago Marathon 2024. Therefore, given my broken marathon block cycle during Delaware...

# Training

I used Pfitz 18/70 again for the Chicago Marathon. This time around though, I wanted to make sure I stayed injured-and-illness-free. I would spend a few minutes warming up before a run, cool-down after runs with a light jog or a walk, stretch on the floor before I went to bed to keep everything loose, implement plyometrics and strength training into my plan, and take multi-vitamins to try to help my bone strength and immune system. I managed to hit 99% of my training runs. During the MP long-runs, I aimed to run around my PR pace. However, during the 18 miles w/ 12 miles at MP, I averaged 5:43 min/mile, which is sub-2:30 pace. I was feeling off the week I was supposed to run 18 miles w/ 14 miles at MP, so I therefore just ran the 18 miles at Zone 2. There were also multiple weeks where I ran above the recommended mileage usually by running recovery miles on the rest/cross-train. One of these weeks, I peaked at 75 MPW.

I had done one tune-up race during this block: The Philadelphia Distance Run (PDR) Half-Marathon. I lowered my PR from 1:13:04 to 1:11:09. After doing extensive research, gauging the thoughts of running reddit communities, and looking at my training times, I felt that if given the right day, I could go sub-2:30. I knew it would be hard, but it could be within reach.

Similarly for the past 3 years, I have been training solo with no coach or running group/team, and very similarly, throughout the last 18 weeks, I still travelled a bunch for work. I ended up in places like the Pacific Northwest, SoCal, and the South, but I was still able to fly to Chicago in preparation for the...

# Pre-Race

**Wednesday:** My partner and I fly into O'Hare and make our way to the AirBnB. I proceed to go out for a short run at dusk.

**Thursday:** I get in a short, light run with strides at ""Marathon feel"" in the morning. I go to the Expo in the afternoon to pickup my bib and explore some of the stands. My parents surprised me and flew into town where we ended up getting a large, pasta dinner in South Loop. We took public transportation and walking to get there.

**Friday:** I was off my feet for the majority of the day. My brother then surprises me flying into town, and we all end up getting dinner about a mile away from my AirBnB. My partner and I walked to and from the restaurant, totaling 1.5 miles, but that was the extent of exercise we got.

**Saturday:** I get in a short shakeout run in the morning. My partner, brother, and I took public transportation and walked to get a deep dish pizza to share in the city. We then proceeded to shortly walk to bus station to go down to the convention center to see the Expo again where my parents had volunteered to hand-out the t-shirts. We checked out the Expo again, and my partner and I take an Uber back to our AirBnB so I can get off my feet. I check the weather, and the temperature, humidity, and wind indicated that it was possible to go sub-2:30. I had also interacted with u/Optimal_Job_2585 to possibly pace together, in which we had agreed to try to meet up. I end up eating a massive pasta dinner, drinking a ton of water, and getting to bed around 10:00 PM.

**Sunday:** My partner and I wake up at 5:00 AM. I put on my old college rowing racing singlet, some compression shorts, and a light cross country shorts as my race outfit. I proceed to put on a hoodie, sweatpants, and walking shoes (as I want to preserve my Nike Vaporfly 3's for the race). I eat some toast with peanut butter, coffee, and water for breakfast. We take the Blue Line to the Jackson station to get to the starting line at around 6:30 AM. I said my goodbyes to my partner, and I walked through security. It was PACKED, so I immediately take off my warm clothes, change into my VaporFly's, and put those clothes in my bag to drop off at my bag check. I hopped into the long porter-potty line at around 6:50 AM. At this time, and I admit it wholeheartedly: I was the one running late, and me and u/Optimal_Job_2585 ended up not meeting up. At 7:10 AM, I realized my corral was closing in 10 minutes, so I made a bee-line to a nearby bush where other people were also going number 1 and number 2 (sponsored by Dude Wipes, since everyone was given a sample with their bag and t-shirt at the Expo).

Well, for those who don't know: I always run with my phone for music. I train by myself most of the time, so music helps keep me occupied when the roads getting long and boring. Anyways, I had my phone in my pocket when I ran from the porter potties to the bush... you can probably guess where this is going. I go to feel my phone in my pocket...

It's not there.

I immediately start panicking and start jogging (which probably was a good move to start warming up lol) back toward the porter potties to find my phone. I can't find it. I'm frantically saying loudly to everyone around ""Has anyone seen a phone?!"" until 7:15 AM. I realize the time and immediately book it to Corral A. I find my way to the Corral where the guy holding the gate says ""You guys have 1 minute!"". At 7:20 AM, I'm trying to stretch, tie my shoes tight, eat a Gu: just anything to keep my mind from going full panic mode from losing my phone in a crowd of 50,000+ people.

After the national anthem and the minute of silence for KeIvin Kiptum, which was absolutely beautiful and impactful, I found a woman with a phone in the crowd behind me, and I explained my situation and asked if I could borrow her phone to call my brother. She was extremely kind and handed me her phone. I managed to get a phone call through to my brother, who was with my partner, and I explain to him I had lost my phone. He was able to use our shared locations to pinpoint it. He said he had an idea and to just focus on the race; they would be there at Mile 2 to support. So at 7:28 AM, I close my eyes, take a few deep breathes, and calm down as I wait for the calmness before the storm...

""Para-athletes... GO!""

""Elites... GO!""

""American Development... GO!""

# Race

*""****GO!!!****""*

**Start to Mile 2:** I start my watch to record and cross the start line.

This. Is. Unreal.

The amount of people at the Start was bewildering to me as I have NEVER been in a marathon this large before. I knew and prepared for the GPS problems in Chicago, so I don't even bother looking at my watch for the first 5k. I focus on trying to maintain my ""Marathon Feel"" strides as it is nearly impossible to get around all the people consuming the road and gliding through the first mile. I finally find an opening and the right ""feel"" after the first Mile, even with the adrenaline influx from the large crowds of people cheering on all the runners. I come through Mile 2, where I hear: ""GO u/Hang-10 GO!"". I look over, and I see my partner cheering me on, but where is my brother?

""u/Hang-10!!"" It's my brother running at my pace on the sidelines. ""Take my phone. Mom found your phone in the park; see you at the Half!""

That's when I realized my parents ALSO volunteered to help at the finish line, and because they were volunteers, they had access to the Park. They somehow found my phone!

Anyways, I manage to get over to grab his phone and immediately focus back in. I realized I didn't want to waste the efforts (nor guess his passcode) to unlock his phone. Therefore, I kept hold of his phone in my hand as a safety blanket, since I was used to the feel of having a phone in-hand while running. I grabbed some water from the aid station, and went head first into:

**Miles 3 to 12:** I realize I'm averaging sub-5:35 min/mile pace coming through Mile 3, and that I need to slow down. I proceed to reel back to about 5:41 to 5:43 min/mile according to my watch, which seemed to correct itself from the craziness of the start at this time. I find other people running the same pace and asked what their goals were. After a few ""sub-2:30"", we had a small group going.

At around Mile 4, I hear ""YO DREXEL!""

For those wondering what D1 rowing college I went to, you found it. I immediately whip my head over my shoulder. It's another runner: ""You raced at the PDR Half this year, right? I was behind you and ran a 1:12! What are you running?""

I told him I was trying for sub-2:30, and he says that was his goal too! He ends up joining our group and we got a solid rhythm going. As we explore the city at a consistent, even pace, and I take my first two Gu's at Miles 5 and 10 while hitting every water station, we finally reach Mile 12. I hear my name being cheered again... its my partner! I smile and wave to her. Again though, where is my brother.... ""u/Hang-10!""

There he is. Running along the side again. I make my way over to him: ""Here's your phone! Get your music going and fucking send it!"". We exchange phones, I turn my earbuds on, queue my playlist, and we finally got EDM beats blasting in my ear.

You know what the weird part was though? This was the first time where I honestly felt like I didn't need music while running. I felt like I could've ran without a phone in general as long as there were runners on the road and people cheering in the stands.

**Mile 13 to 18:** I come in at the half, and my watch says ""1:14:25"". Perfect. I'm executing the pace I want, and I feel solid. I take another Gu at Mile 15. I'm continuing to hit every water station to battle the humidity and cool myself off.

I don't know how or why, but something clicked when I came through Mile 18. I suddenly get a feeling in my mind and my legs that this race might not go according to plan...

**Mile 18 to 19**: Okay. That's not big deal, maybe sub-2:30 isn't in the cards today. We can still go sub-2:32! We still have 8 miles to go, so let's slow down from our Mile 18 split of 5:45 min/mile to our Mile 19 split of 5:48 min/mile...

**Mile 19 to 20:** I can still feel my leg strength start to slowly but surely fade. Okay! No big deal, we can still PR if we just hang on at our Marathon PB pace. Let's slow down from our Mile 19 split of 5:48 min/mile to our Mile 20 split of 5:55 min/mile... and have a Gu! That'll replenish me!

**Mile 20 to 22:** Okay, legs are still fading, but we can still keep this in control. Let's slow down from our Mile 20 split of 5:55 min/mile and average 6:10 min/mile for Miles 21 and 22. We can still PR if we just hang on for dear life. You got this! What could go wrong?

**Mile 22 to 23:** My vision goes black. The sirens are going off in my head. All I'm thinking is ""Oh No Bro"" (Regular Show reference for those that may get it). Pace drops DRASTICALLY from 6:11 min/mile to 6:47 min/mile. An influx of runners pass me. Let's just try to keep the last 5k under 7:00 min/mile average...

**Mile 23 to 24:** Alright, we're a bit over 7:00 min/mile split, but I think I have enough room to kick it here...

**Mile 24 to 25:** *A shooting pain consumes my left hamstring.* I'm still running but hobbling in what feels like agonizing pain. I'm running, straight-legged through the aid station and drink 3 cups of water, but nothing is unlocking it. I just want to give up. I just want to stop. I just can't do this.

I then notice other runners around me stop running and walk, stretch, and one runner cramped up completely and had to crawl on his hands and knees to the side. Then I hear a familiar voice:

""u/Hang-10! Hang on man, you got this!"" - it was the guy who recognized me and my Drexel shirt from the PDR Half. I yell every other word under a gruntled breath as he flies past me ""Fucking send it!""

I just thought to myself in that moment ""unless my body absolutely fails me. I will. Not. Fucking. Stop.""

**Mile 25 to 26:** Pace at this point is irrelevant. Just finish. The 1-Mile left sign pops up. Just 1 mile of pain and suffering, and we're there. We can do this; we didn't come all this way to not finish. Please just hang on.

**Mile 26 to Finish**: I see the final overpass. I don't care anymore. I turn on the jet engines I have left, which at this point is the horsepower equivalent to what felt like a child in a Little Tikes toy car (A link for reference, NOT A ADVERTISEMENT: [https://www.amazon.com/Little-Tikes-642302M-Cozy-Coupe/dp/B01LY451EC?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Tikes-642302M-Cozy-Coupe/dp/B01LY451EC?th=1) ).

200 meters left... 100 meters left... My vision goes black again. I don't care anymore. The announcer calls my name as I stumble across the finish.

# Post-Race

My vision comes back, and I see my parents, who volunteered again to hand out medals and beers, right at the front of the finish line. They're smiles quickly turned to concern: My eyes are soulless with no emotion and I'm stumbling forward yet side-to-side just to keep my feet moving so I don't cramp up. I feel my arm being grabbed, and I hear ""Put your arm over my shoulder."" A kind volunteer saw me struggling and helped me walk down the long road back to the Park. My parents come up to me and say, ""Glad to see you got your phone! We'll see you soon as we're almost done."" The volunteer then guides me to get my medal and some water. I couldn't eat any food as my stomach was absolutely nauseous from the experience I just went through. After about 10 minutes of walking, I finally regain my stride and thank the volunteer for her help. I then slowly grab my checked bag and make my way over to the Mile 27 Post-Party. Here, I hop back into my warmer clothes, change my shoes, and check the results online to see my finishing time...

***2:36:49. I missed my PR by 1:17.***

My girlfriend and brother find me in the Post-Party area and congratulate me with huge smiles on their faces. They were both worried that when they saw my splits drop the way they did that something had seriously gone wrong, *referring to my previous collapsed lung*.

I hug my brother, and then I hug my partner, who I've been with since the start of my running journey. I don't know what happened, maybe it was the rollercoaster of an experience I just went through, but as soon as I made contact with her, I just began to cry.

""I was so close."" I told them as I hid my sobbing. ""I didn't even PR. I was on-track to run sub-2:30, and I completely blew it by almost 7 minutes.""

They both reminded me that 3 years ago, I was in a hospital bed with a tube in my ribcage and couldn't even run. Now, I've progressed my marathon time down to a split that wasn't even conceivable to me for more than a 10k when I first started running. It really brought me back to reality and put the entire experience into a different perspective. As I cheered up, we proceeded to find a spot where could hang out while waiting to meet up with my parents.

# Alright u/Hang-10 you talk about your phone too much. What's Next?

Well, in the wise words of South Park: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdjkLIEtVl4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdjkLIEtVl4)

I spent a few days in Chicago unwinding with my partner, where I also suffered a little bit of the stomach flu the day after the race. We then flew back home from O'Hare the day after where I unpacked, re-packed later that night, and flew out to the West Coast the following morning for work again where I am currently typing this Race Report.

I did manage to remember to register for Boston 2025 in September, and I made the cutoff based on my time at the Delaware Running Festival. Therefore, the Boston Marathon will be my next race where I have my ""eyes on the prize"". Today, I also registered in the ""Fast Runner"" category for the 2025 Berlin Marathon, so hopefully I get a solid chance of making the lottery/cut since my time is under the time qualifier (2:45:00).

Honestly, I don't know what to do from here. I thought when I ran the Delaware Running Festival, I had the capabilities to get into the 2:20s, and based off feedback from other experienced runners, maybe, in a few years and a bunch more miles, hit an OTQ. It's a delusional thought, I know, but it would be awesome if I have the potential to achieve it, to actually try to go for it. Therefore, I ask you all...

# What are your thoughts? What can I do to be better?

# Conclusion and Thank You

Either way, the goal at the end of the day, for me, is to always, ALWAYS, have fun. This is a sport I can see myself doing for many many years, and I don't want to force the joy out of it with burnout. I want to be able to run with a smile when I'm 65+. While I was suffering during this race, as I look back at all the runners I met, the support my loved ones showed, and the absolute crazy support the crowd brought throughout all 26.2 miles of Chicago, it was honestly a BLAST. One Abbott World Major down, five more to go.

I know this was a long-winded race report, but it was honestly a ton of fun to write, and I hope for those of you here that made it this far, you enjoyed it as much as I did drafting it. If you did make it this far, thank you for taking the time to read this post. I hope I continue having fun with running so that I can continue to be able to write these long, sometimes off-topic, race reports.

Report

Pre-Race Prep and Getting to the Start Line

The race was to start at 8.30am so I got up at 5.45am to make sure I could eat some porridge (a classic Quaker Oats pot which I added water to + covered in honey), a glass of water with electrolytes and an espresso (and also do my business). I also had some maurten powder which I used to fill 2 mini juice bottles for my partner to hand to me at 12km and 24km in (they were life-saving).

The hotel I was staying at was about a 40 min walk or a 15 min taxi from the start line. Supposedly Uber was available but they wanted to take 20min+ to arrive at the hotel which would have made me nervously late to arrive, but luckily I got chatting with someone at my hotel also running (himself going for a sub 2:30 time - yikes) who had a taxi and was happy to give me a lift. Thank you, kind stranger!

Got to the venue around 7.45am and it was pretty quick going to get in. I had already picked up my bib the previous day at the expo, and so it was just a case of showing my bib number (already pinned to my vest) to get through the barriers and I was in. I used the bathroom here and found there were plenty of portaloo's so the queues went down pretty quickly. Bag drop off was pretty efficient too - they had signs for different bib number ranges (e.g. 10,000-10,100) and so I located my spot and dropped off my bag (again using a tag they'd given me the previous at the expo).

I got to my starting pen at 8.08am (I remember looking at my watch) and wanting to do a warm up, I did circuits of this very small area for about 10 mins at my recovery pace. There were quite a few others doing this and it was a bit crowded, but somehow I managed it and even did some mini strides to get a bit warmed up. I was in the 3'15""-3'30"" pen as I was originally going for 3'20"" before having to change my goals to 3'30""; I got wiped out by the flu 2 weeks ago and couldn't run for about 8 days and was practically straight into my taper.

I got talking to other people in my pace group to see where I should start (expecting to be at the back), and found actually most people were either being falsely modest OR were in the wrong place, with most people aiming to be sub 4. I was bit worried at this point that there was going to be a lot of weaving going on.

My race plan was to take gels every 6km and aim for roughly 4'53"" splits for at least the first half, and then see how I felt after then. My partner was to hand me maurten filled mini juice bottles at 12km and 24km marks too.

The Race Itself

- The event started on time and we were jogging to the startline with an MC bellowing excitedly and loud music booming through the area.
- 1st 12km were pretty uneventful - I had been warned by many-a-friend to not go out too quick, so kept at 4'55"" - 5'00"" pace according to my watch and happily took my gel at 6km and collected my sugar water at 12km from my partner. This section went north for a bit from the start line, then east and into what seemed like a mostly industrial area of the city before circling around to the start line again.
- 12km-24km - picked up the pace (according to my watch) to 4'53"" but my watch kept beeping for a 1km about 10-20s earlier than the km markers. Clearly I wasn't running the most efficient line and there had been a decent amount of weaving going on as people were starting to slow. Again gel at 18km and sugar water collected at 24km. I had been taking water at every opportunity, and was starting to feel the need to want to urinate which would have ruined my goal. Luckily this feeling went away towards the early 20km's.
- I had been told that by 21km I should still feel fresh and then 32km start to feel it but ready to push on.
- At 21km my legs were starting to feel very heavy 😂 I told myself to keep pushing on through and hold the pace.
- By 30km I felt awful - legs very sluggish, though surprisingly didn’t feel out of breath at all. My right toe was suddenly very painful then numb, which I thought of as a post-race me problem. I started slowing into 5’00” and early 5’05” range and told myself I’d banked enough seconds in the first 20km to hopefully have some buffer. Gel taken at 30km.
- Around 34km I drank some water, doused some over my head at the water station and had a second life. Managed to get back into the 4’50”-4”55 mark according to my watch.
- About 6km to go we started going through around the beautiful Plaza de España and through the old town (it might have been the opposite order, I can’t remember). It was beautiful scenery to be running through and in hindsight was a welcome distraction from all the pain and doubt creeping in!
- Unfortunately, it had started getting quite congested through narrow streets and roads and so I was slowed down to the early 5’00”s for a couple of km. Was probably a good thing as my HR dropped abit.
- In the final 2km, people were dropping like flies: a man grasping his calf and taking himself off to the side, another woman seeking medical attention wrapped in a silver blanket. It felt like a warzone - I didn’t feel any particular tightness or cramping so thought I’d be okay. Keep going!
- With 500m to go I pushed and hit 4’30” pace (legs feeling the heaviest they’d ever felt in my life) but I got there!
- No indication of my final time but the clock was just over 3h 30m…

Immediate Post Race

- After crossing the line, I somehow stayed upright and asked a stranger for a photo. It was awful…
- I was given my medal, then after a short queue given a goodie bag and a silver space blanket - the goodie bag had a Powerade / sports drink, water and a chocolate wafer. 
- People were queueing to take photos by the Seville Marathon banner, which looked long and I was desperate for some sustenance so avoided that and went looking for my partner.
- I found my partner in the adjacent park who gave me a protein yoghurt drink we’d found in a supermarket the night before and I downed another sports drink. Started to feel vaguely human again.
- I then queued to get my medal engraved with my name. It turns out they engrave your time too - **3h 29m 18s**. I’d hit my goal! I couldn’t walk, my right big toe was going to be fun to deal with, but I’d made it!

Thoughts on the shoes

- I could barely walk at this point and when I took off my shoe, discovered my right big toe was black and very painful. 
- Generally they were very good and cushioned through the race, not sure if there was something with the toe box though as my right big toe was bruised (likely to come off 🥲 later) sadly.
- This hasn’t happened during any of my training runs in these shoes otherwise I would have tried some other pair!
- Next time, I’ll probably opt for another pair of shoes with a wider / better fitting toe box."

How did the long runs and long runs with MP mileage feel to you? Short version, being hardheaded and going couch to marathon in under a year, no race history to base paces off of, and doing everything off HHR% with chest strap, based off age/resting heart rate formula. I know the formula isn't the most accurate way of determining things. Doing 18/55, have made to week 8 (8 weeks out from race), and had a 16mi, 12mi at MP, yesterday (end of week 9). Granted it was much warmer and more humid than 98% of my training thus far, the 12mi at marathon pace didn't seem sustainable. I pushed through, but the final 3-4 miles my heart rate was bouncing off the upper end of the marathon pace range. 

Supplemental info: 39/m, new runner as of August 2024, 30-35mpw 3mo prior to 18/55. Current HM, not raced, but in training 02:02:30. Yes I know 18/55 is not ideal for a 4hr+ 1st timer. Not in it to have fun, in it to push myself lol. 

  
I'm not too proud to adjust my goal, but I also know there's fatigue over 10 weeks of training so far, plus building base mileage for several months prior could play into it. I've seen people report that these runs are sometimes super tough, but I also don't know if they're supposed to be tough. I don't mind the work to do them, but inexperience also doesn't know how I should feel. That 16 this weekend was a lot tougher than the 20 last weekend. "

### Background

This past April, I ran a 2:53:16 at the Queens Marathon in NY.  This was a last minute pivot from the Cheap Marathon in Derry, NH, which, four days before the race, was postponed two weeks due to an ice storm.  I detailed that [in this race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1byk0uz/the_queens_marathon_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/), but the big takeaway was that I thought I had the fitness to have run a better time, but the course was tricky to navigate and surprisingly difficult.  I felt that due to sharp turns I ended up runninga non negligible amount extra (even factoring in that you never truly run 26.2), which I thought impacted my performance.  I also started too slow and couldn't make it up, because I was trying to run in a group.  Overall, I felt I was just on the wrong side of a BQ, and unfortunately this turned out to be true, when I missed qualifying for Boston by seven seconds.

The good news is that I had already scheduled Chicago, and so back in April I decided that I wouldn't try to push for an early September last chance race, and instead would focus on ""leaving no doubt"" for Boston 2026.

### Training 


I followed Pfitz's 18/70 quite effectively.  While I don't think I ran every workout, and I switched the order of a few, I estimate that I hit 90% of the plan.  

[Training weekly mileage here, including the long run mileage](https://imgur.com/J697wIN), and a comparison of my [last few plans here](https://imgur.com/wYlc6Ja).  I hit 60+ most weeks after the ""true start"" of my plan (the 6th week in on the chart), including 70 at least once.  The big down week in the middle (Week of July 22^nd) was because I went to a wedding Thursday-Sunday, but this worked out as a sort of mini recovery week for me. I peaked at 73 miles 3 weeks before the race.  The horizontal green line is at 60 miles, and the horizontal orangey-brown line is at 20 miles.  I ended up doing 6 runs over 20 miles, and 10 over 18 miles.  Additionally, my weekly medium long runs peaked at 15 miles, and I think I did about 10 weeks with that run over 12 miles.

I also continued my traditional twice weekly strength training, doing one ""push"" day and one ""pull"" day.  This typically looked like a Tuesday/Thursday split, with the ""push"" day being squats, bench, OHP, goblet squats, and bulgarian split squats, while the ""pull"" day was deadlifts, single leg RDLs, pullups, and rows.  This was heavy lifting (for me), typically doing 3 sets of 5-8 reps.  I also added in plyometrics and core work, usually on Wednesdays.  Mostly this looked like ab wheels, various planks, hollow holds, and supermans, with plyo being box jumps, pogo squats, and depth drops/jumps.   

I tapered for two weeks, dropping to about 60% of max the first week and 40% (pre race) the second week.  Taper felt horrible and, as per tradition, I thought I was injured.  It mostly, but not completely, went away on race day.

### Pre-race

My wife and I flew out to Chicago on Friday evening, had dinner with some friends, and went to bed.  Saturday, we went to the expo, met up with some more friends and hung out until the evening.  
We had a nice dinner around 5 PM, went back to the hotel, and got to bed around 8 PM for a 4:30 wakeup.  I ate two bagels with cream cheese and walked to the race. There, I hung out for a while, did a short leg swing warmup, and got ready for the start.

I was in Corral B, and we could watch the elites. I was standing there wearing a Tokyo 2024 fuzzy poncho which I got from a friend, and (I thought) a random Japanese sub elite (with a name, not a number) on his bib walked up, pointed at me through the fence, and said something I didn't catch. I smiled at him, gave him a thumbs up, and said good luck.  He smiled and gave me at thumbs up too, and walked away.

Turns out it was Toshiki Sadakata, who finished 8th overall with a 2:08:22.  
### Race

I started about five minutes after the gun and took off. There was a lot of congestion early, so I was about 15 seconds slow on my first mile, but I expected that, so I wasn't worried.  My wife and dad were at mile 2 (and a few more places!) and they provided both moral and nutritional support.  I saw them 4 times total, and stopped for 2-3 seconds each time except the last to kiss my wife.

Throughout the race I drank two Maurten drink mixes and had three Maurten gels.  One mix and two gels were caffeinated.  I also drank water and gatorade at each station.

I stuck to my plan, and honestly, there's not much to talk about. I don't remember any specific details, and nothing too odd happened. Shoutout to a friend, who had a ""Shrek is Love"" sign at mile 11 (IYKYK), which apparently got a lot of laughs. My legs felt kind of sore from the get go, but it didn't really imapct me, and I hit the half about 9 seconds slower than I wanted total, so pretty much right on.  I picked it up a little bit at mile 18, and then really put the hammer down around mile 24.  Towards the end, I was passing people left and right, which felt great. I blew my wife a kiss at mile 26 and sprinted to the finish.

### Post-race

I teared up as I crossed the line, pretty confident in the moment (and now) that this would be enough for 2026.  I ran into a guy I met at a 10K in Boston 6 weeks ago who finished in 2:44, and we got pizza together with my family.

I'm writing this in the airport as I wait for my delayed flight home.
### Final Thoughts

I think I'm in to Boston 2026, which is the culmination of a 3 year mission.  Next, I'll aim to go sub 1:20 in a half in a few weeks.  I don't have any marathons planned in the next year, and will instead focus on shorter stuff -- I want to get under 17 in the 5K (currently, I'm at 17:30).  This is a big change -- it's the first time in nearly three years I don't have a marathon planned, and it's kind of a relief.

# Background

I’ve been running for just under two years now, with two marathons under my belt. My first marathon clocked in at 4:19:xx back in May 2023, and my second, this past May, finished in 3:17. I had a very strong finish in that race, negative splitting pretty aggressively.

I was shocked by my results because I had trained for four months aiming for a sub-3:30, averaging around 35 miles per week. On race day, I wasn’t even feeling very confident about achieving sub-3:30, but my body said otherwise that day.

These results led me to believe I was ready to train for a sub 3. So, shortly after this race, I signed up for CIM, which was six months away.

# Training

I began my training block in August, following the “Unofficial Pfitz 18/63 Full Marathon Plan.” Knowing my body, I felt the Pfitz 55 plan was too light, while the 70 plan seemed too intense, so I aimed for a sweet spot in between.

Training didn’t go exactly as planned, with life occasionally getting in the way, resulting in a handful of weeks with lower mileage (less than 50 mpw). Over the course of the block, I averaged around 45 mpw, with most weeks falling in the 50–55 mpw range and peaking at 60 mpw.

Despite the lower and inconsistent mileage, I felt I had high-quality runs throughout the block. I hit the prescribed paces for long runs and medium-long runs from the Pfitz plan for the most part. However, I struggled early on with marathon-paced long runs, failing to hit the target 6:50 pace in the first two attempts. Fortunately, in the final two marathon-paced long runs, I managed to hit a 6:50 pace, though they were far from easy and didn’t leave me feeling confident about going sub-3.

The two key training indicators that gave me hope for sub-3 were a 10K time trial I completed a month before the marathon, finishing in 38:30 on the track, and my final long run of 20 miles, where I averaged a 7:12 pace with ease, running without water or gels.

# Pre-race

I did a fairly half-baked carb load in the two days leading up to the race, simply trying to eat as many carb-dense foods as possible without actually tracking anything. This included 2 pounds of gummy bears spread across the two days, plenty of bread, and, most importantly, a lot of Little Caesars garlic bread the night before.

# Race

Nutrition -  I packed 5 GU gels and a 200mg caffeine pill, planning to take the pill around the halfway point. I ended up using all 5 gels, taking one roughly every 20 minutes throughout the race. I also grabbed a couple more gels from the aid stations (breaking the cardinal rule of trying new things on race day).

0–5km The first 5km was chaotic, as I had never been part of a marathon this large before. Seeing so many sub-3 runners in the corral was pretty crazy. My focus during this stretch was to settle in and find a pack to run with.

5–21km After 5km, I managed to settle into a steady rhythm, running with a consistent pack at my 2:57 goal pace

The infamous rolling hills of CIM lived up to their reputation. I was surprised by how frequent they were it never really felt like i was running on flat ground at any point of the course. It was either up or down the entire way. Fortunately, I’ve trained at elevation and on rolling hills, so I felt prepared and managed them fairly well.

That said, I wasn’t feeling as good as I’d hoped during this stretch. Doubts crept in that I might crash somewhere around the 25–27km mark. I focused on staying relaxed and taking  what my body would give me. I also had a very strong urge to pee pretty much the entire run and It didn't help that I drank fluids at every aid station.

21–32km By 25km, fatigue started to hit hard. My calves and ankles were tightening up, and my legs were beginning to feel like bricks. Despite that, I somehow managed to pick up the pace, I tried to create some variation in my stride and foot strike to prevent cramps in my calves.

Around this point, I found a pack of three other runners, and we worked together to keep the pace strong. It was pretty satisfying to pass others who were starting to burn out and gave me some extra energy to keep pushing.

30–42km The final 12km was a brutal mental and physical battle. I was fighting demons and holding on for dear life, trying to maintain my pace. By 35km, I realized that if I could finish strong, I might not only break 3:00 with ease but also BQ and go sub-2:55.

I didn’t want to push too aggressively, though, as my calves felt on the verge of cramping at any moment. When I hit the final mile, the crowd energy and adrenaline kicked in. I floored it running the last mile or so at around 6:18 pace to get sub 2:55. Unfortunately, I came up just short, finishing 50 seconds over. Maybe if I had floored it a little sooner I could've made it but I also beleive i would've for sure cramped up.

# Post-race

Even though I didn’t BQ, I was thrilled to go sub-3:00. Going into the race, I had a lot of doubts due to my inconsistent mileage, and during the race, the fatigue was intense.

Out of the three marathons I’ve run, this was by far the most exhausting. Moving forward I think I'll aim for around a 2:50 marathon time in the summer to ensure a safe buffer for a BQ.

# Background

I'm 35M. I’ve ran 7 marathons and my BQ time was 2:57:56 (Carlsbad marathon 2024). I’ve dabbled with road races, triathlons, and trail ultras since about 2012. This opportunity to run Boston was a bucket list race for me so I was motivated to train well for it and run an awesome race.

# Training

My training did not go to plan at all. I started in October last year with easy base miles, working up to about 45mpw in December. The repetitive easy road runs wore me down and I developed a strain in my left soleus to the point where it hurt to walk. Took 1.5 months off running and did some calf strengthening rehab and got back in training mode in February - only 2.5 months out from race day. Needless to say I was pretty stressed about it but I have a new training program a go: the FIRST method (Furman Institute Running Scientific Training) by Bill Pierce. If you are not familiar, it’s a low mileage, high intensity program with 3 focused runs per week and 2 cross training days (they call it 3 plus 2). I decided to give it a try since the calf issue was less prominent at faster paces. Here was a normal week for me:

| Day       | Workout                                              |
|:----------|-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Monday    | rest/recovery/core                                   |
| Tuesday   | track workout (speed)                                   |
| Wednesday | 20-25 mile zone 2 bike ride               |
| Thursday | tempo run                      
|
| Friday    | AM yoga                      
|
| Saturday  | bike hill interval workout      
|
| Sunday    | long run                                 
|

I really liked this format. It’s definitely not for everyone but I always felt strong on my long runs and focused on keeping a faster pace (7:15 average). I worked my way up to 22 miles with some race pace intervals (6:40). The bike interval saturdays were a huge contributor to increased fitness. Usually consisted of 5x a popular climb about 20 miles from me resulting in a 50 mile ride. Stacking this with a long run on the weekends rendered me pretty useless the rest of the day but I could see tangible progress in faster recovery on my intervals and pushing the distance on my long runs. I always trained with nutrition (maurten gels + tailwind bottle at “aid station I set up at my front door. The runs were repetitive out and backs but I found it to be more effective this way than carrying all that stuff. My training shoes were the Adidas Adizero Boston 12s and they were great. My worst workout was always my tempo run, bonking out at 2.5/3 miles. I never ran 1 effective tempo run in the whole cycle which was a confidence killer.

I really enjoyed this format for training, and miraculously the calf held up with it. I also cut out most meat in my diet and quit alcohol (not a big drinker to begin with). This had immediate weight loss implications going from 174 pounds to 168 (I’m 6’1”) in 2 weeks. My weight stayed stable at 168, until the taper when I got up to 172.

Despite not getting several training cycles under my belt for Boston and the condensed regiment, I felt confident in my fitness that I could have a good race. I’m looking forward to trying the FIRST method again as it seemed to work well for me.

# Pre-Race

As a first time Boston runner, I used this sub heavily as a reference for tips. So thank you all for contributing! This allowed me to be prepared for the very long pre-race starting point shuttles. We had beautiful weather - sunny and 50 at the start. I enjoyed my 25 minute Power Nap at athletes village before the trek out to the corrals. Hopkinton is such a cute place - was very cool to see all the home owners out there wishing everyone a good race. Shoutout to the people with the sunscreen stations! Many people benefited from them. I laced up my Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 4s and got to my corral (wave 1, corral 7) just in time. We hit the starting line around 10:06 and we were off to the races!

# Race

I took the advice I had heard from many others to go out conservative and that you need to conserve energy for after mile 21 when you get done with the big hills. I cruised those early miles at a super easy 6:40 pace - the road is freshly paved and was an absolute dream to run on (especially in the fresh race shoes!). I was amazed at the crowds right from the start. They lined the course literally the entire way from mile 0 to 26.2 and they brought the energy all day. This is probably the coolest thing about the Boston Marathon. I cruised the early miles and gave out lots and lots of high fives, grinning from ear to ear.

- Miles 4-17: my goal was to keep it steady around 6:40 pace and I was doing a pretty good job of it. It was awesome to have so many equal level runners to share the course with. At one point I caught a glance of my heart rate and it said 198. Omg. Way too high this early. I decided it was better to just ignore that and keep the pace steady since the miles were really clicking by quickly. I grabbed the endurance Gatorade and water at every aid station. They’re set up on both sides of the road which is very helpful.

- Miles 17-22: this is where the course gets tough. Lots of people start walking. Some even drop out. I felt strong on the hills and crested each one leading up to heartbreak hill with relative ease. I credit the cycling uphill interval workouts for that! Heartbreak was a longer climb and it resulted in my slowest split (7:08 at mile 21) but I was happy to get through the hard part and grit it out for the finish.

- Miles 23-26.2: here is where the hurt settled in! I was gritting my teeth and getting hyper focused to have a strong finish. Mile 23 was the hardest mile of the day for me. I took one last gel (had about 7 on the course) and gave it one last big push. My body bounced back and I found my stride again to put together a strong finish down Boylston street - what an atmosphere! It felt incredible to charge to the line passing people that entire stretch. I thought I could hit my goal time of 2:55 but due to the extra +0.2 distance gained from bobbing and weaving through the water stations I was not able to do so. But it was a huge PR or 1 minute and 16 seconds and I couldn’t be happier to have done it at Boston.  

# Post-Race

What an incredible day. Perfect weather, a PR, and an awesome experience. This race is truly all what it’s cracked up to be. Amazing event. My favorite part was giving all the kids out there high fives and having my loving wife and parents and in-laws there to support me and share the experience with. Still on a high and I can’t sleep because I’m all amped up! Thanks for reading."

It was my first marathon. Was hoping for a time of 3:20, but ended up around 3:25. The last 10k got to me, with cramps and felt like my legs were in cement.

I followed Pfitz’s 18/55 plan. Had my long training pace at around 8:05-8:20. Didn’t miss any major runs. I think my goal time was missed due to the following:

1. Did not really do strength training other than squats and dynamic lunges a couple times per week. Will definitely add that next time.

2. I might have messed up my race day nutrition. I had some oatmeal and a protein bar a few hours before the race. Was going to eat a honey stinger waffle at the start but I guess I was too nervous and forgot. I had 4 Gu’s and 1 Sis gel throughout the race, but probably should have fueled at every 30 minutes. I stopped for Gatorade at every other station, but did not end up consuming as much as I needed. By the second half of the race, the mix was pretty diluted and I should have had more earlier. The biggest thing was that I did not trust my gut to add more during the race and I felt like 5 gels was enough with the carb load I did the previous 3 days.

3. I only did one race prep for this marathon, a 10k in November. Ran it in about 41 minutes, which Vdot suggests gave me a shot at a sub 3:20 marathon. While I had many long runs well in excess of 13 miles. I probably should have raced a 1/2 somewhere in there.

4. My heart rate was surprisingly low the whole marathon, but I think my garmin was off for that. I definitely felt like I was breathing harder than my heart rate suggested.

All in all, I really enjoyed it and would love to hear from the community on what I can do to get a time of sub 3:20."

# Background and Training

I'm 41F, played sports in high school but not particularly gifted, athletically. Have run casually over the years, but never more than 10k or so. Started running longer distances in 2023 and completed Pittsburgh HM in 1:56:28 without a structured training plan (although I was running very consistently at that point). Last year, I trained for my first full using Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 hoping for sub-4. I completed 100% of the runs and was very optimistic going in, but started to crash by mile 16 and it was all downhill from there. I pouted for a day and then signed up for 2025, vowing to take revenge.

Did a 10k training block over the summer and added some strength work at home. Completed a September 10k in 48:52 and a 10-miler in October in 1:22:36, so I went in to the marathon block with a much stronger base than before (probably 30-35 avg mpw).

For the marathon, I decided to try Pfitz 18/55. First few weeks, I was following it pretty loosely - hitting weekly mileage but shifting the days around and not following the workouts exactly. Around week 4/5, I started following properly, but had some hiccups. I had a one-week vacation in early February where I only got to \~18 miles for the week. Then in March, I completed a 16 mile MP workout even though I was starting to come down with a bug and ended up getting sicker than I'd been in years and missing 2-3 runs. The worst came during the final weeks of peak training when I threw out my back while leaning over to change some bed sheets. I could barely walk or sit for a week, let alone run. So I didn't run at all for 1 1/2 weeks and missed two long runs, including my last 20-miler, and wondered if I would have to find a fall marathon and try again. But luckiluy I regained mobility and came back cautiously for the taper, cutting one long run short and holding back during my workouts. Ultimately, I saw a PT who told me it was safe to run despite some residual weirdness in my hip.

# Pre-race

A freak storm threw an additional wrench in my plans the Tuesday before my race when hurricane-level winds downed trees all over the city, leaving more than 300k people without power. Most of the outages were restored by race day, but as I type now, I still have no electricity. So on the day of, I got ready in the dark and had my breakfast by candlelight. At least it wasn't raining.

# Race

Walking up to my corral, my hip was feeling aggravated and I was pretty nervous since I wasn't sure how much fitness I had lost due to my injury. I told myself that it didn't matter how fast I finished as long as I could avoid blowing up at the end. When the race started, I tried to stick with the 4:15 pacer and resist the urge to go out too fast. However, after about a mile in, it really felt like they were going too slow and I decided to run my own race. I focused on my RPE and backed off if I felt like I was pushing, but I also allowed myself to let loose a little on the down hills. Before long, my hip had warmed up and I pretty much cruised to mile 12 where the HM splits off and the marathon runners climb the biggest hill of the course. This is where the race really starts in my opinion.

I started comparing how I was feeling to similar points from the previous year. To my delight, I hit miles 16/17 (where I started slowing the year before) and I was fine! I started seeing people slow down and drop off, and full disclosure, I could feel their pain but it felt pretty good pass them. I reached an intersection where my niece and daughter were planning to hand off some snacks, but they weren't there, which was a little disappointing. Soon after, they texted to say that I was moving faster than expected and they were going to try to come find me later on. This actually provided a little extra entertainment in these later miles since I didn't know where they would pop up. Around mile 20? I heard my daughter yelling for me and saw her waving. I picked up the pace and grabbed my snacks - two peeled mandarins and some sour candy. I snacked on the mandarins through the next few miles and they were perfect, saw my neighbor cheering me around mile 22/23.

At mile 24 there is a big downhill section that was absolutely brutal on my quads the year before. I remember wanting more than anything to let gravity take me down the hill, but every step was an explosion of pain. This year.. I was fine! I floated down with no problems! My watch was showing an average pace of 9:07 so I knew sub-4 was possible, but it was a little murky because the distance on my watch was not exactly aligned with the mile markers. I ate some sour candies, dug deep, and allowed myself to push through the last 5k. Crossed the finish with a chip time of 4:01.. close enough!

# Post-race

Walking back to the car was difficult and the top of my right ankle was hurting because I had locked down my heel a little too tight. Overall however, recovery has been much quicker this time around! After a soak in the tub, I was walking around just fine. No difficulty with stairs or anything. I actually wasn't even sore this morning and no problems with my back or hip.

# Reflections and Lessons Learned

Here are my thoughts as to why the two races were so different and why this year was so much better despite having more setbacks during training.

1. **Time and Consistency.** I had a whole extra year of consistently running 12+ mile distances. I imagine there are certain physical adaptations that just aren't going to occur in a single training block, regardless of how faithfully you stick to it.
2. **Training.** After 2024 I vowed to start strength training, spend less time on the treadmill, and embrace the hills. In terms of strength training, I didn't do anything crazy. I bought a few dumbells on FB marketplace and tried to do \~20 minutes a few times per week. I was mostly consistent but definitely took some breaks and stopped completely after I threw out my back, with the exception of some PT exercises. When I first got back into running in 2022ish, my home treadmill was a game changer. I was able to run in the morning while my daughter was sleeping (I'm a single parent), zone out and catch up on TV shows. I still did longer runs outside, but would go out of my way to avoid hills. I definitely paid the price for this in 2024. Now, I still use the treadmill when I need to, but I do the majority of my runs outside on hilly terrain (which is easy to come by in Pittsburgh).
3. **Weight and Nutrition.** Some people on this sub are going to disagree with me on this, but I will share my experience anyway. In 2024 I heeded all the warnings of under fueling. I generally eat a pretty healthy home cooked diet, but I allowed myself to snack as much as I wanted and fueled all my runs with gels. Ultimately, I gained about 15lbs during training and it absolutely hurt me during the race. Afterward, I counted calories and lost 20 lbs *while training for a 10k*. I cut out added sugar and ate bananas before runs instead. And I felt great, made gains, and exceeded my race goal. By the time I started marathon training, I had gained a little weight over the holidays. This time around, I paid much closer attention to what I was eating. I brought dates on runs over 12 miles, but avoided gels and candy, with the exception of my final MP long run just to make sure I would be fine taking them on race day. I didn't count calories at first, but started counting when I injured my back so that I wouldn't gain weight while I wasn't running. Overall, I probably lost \~10lb during the training block. In 2024, I was near the top end of BMI for my height but not technically overweight. I was 20lbs lighter in 2025 (lean but not close to underweight) and it *absolutely* helped. All that to say, you can lose weight, fuel your runs, and train for a race at the same time. It may not be the best path for everyone, but for those of us who love to eat and gain weight easily, it can be a good strategy. Also, I ate more carbs/gels during the 2024 race where I bonked than I did yesterday. More sugar is not always the answer!

Anyway, not sure if anyone is still reading at this point, but it was fun to write it all down. Now I have to decide if I want to do it all again next year.

The last 10K were as brutally unforgiving as I remembered, but I mostly felt good and in control throughout, which was a marked improvement from the dumpster fire of the second half the previous year.

### Background
I got achilles tendonitis a few weeks out from a fall Half–which I ran anyway and *smashed* (set all my current sub-marathon distance PRs)--but prolonged the recovery quite a bit as a result.  *And then* I got shingles *and then* had eye surgery, so I lost the rest of the year plus more recovering from all that.  


So while I was slated to kick off Pfitz 18/70 Dec 1, I had to scrap it and just take it week by week, carefully building my base back up, which took me well into January.
  

### Pre-race
Kicked off a 3-week taper after a 20-miler (peak length LR) run at 8:33 pace, felt good.  Mileage for those weeks looked like 52 - 34 - 16, with a final run 2 days prior (a hard-run 5K).

Landed on a 2-day carbo-load, 500g per day, which, despite being 100g under the recommended amount, still felt terrible and hard to reach (I’m usually at 300g a day).  I didn’t have any issues during the race, so it worked out I guess?


### Race
Absolutely perfect weather to start.  A touch warm toward the last third, but I'm not complaining.

**Miles 1-11**

Amazing.  My HR cadence locked here, so I was running by RPE, which was just in auto-cruise mode.  


I felt the onset of a side cramp around mile 4 that I fought off and didn't feel again for the rest of the race.  TBH, I consider this like one of the biggest wins for me this race.


Tailed the 3:30 pacer for quite a bit and passed him around mile 6.  I got to dump my jacket + headband + handwarmers on my parents around mile 8, as the temperature had risen considerably, and wave at my cheering spouse and kiddo at mile 11.  


**Miles 12-15**


This was the point where I started to struggle last year.  I’d definitely gone out too fast and was paying the price with the ramped up ascents.  This year, the elevation changes didn’t hit nearly as hard (leg days paying off??), and while my pace slowed a bit, I remember not feeling nearly as miserable. 


**Miles 16 - 20**


I began to pass a lot of runners who were walking the hills  (I was definitely one of those runners last year).  I distinctly remember a hill that thoroughly destroyed me, and climbed it this time like it was nothing.  


And then, my feet started to cramp???  This has literally never happened to me before on any run, and I totally blame my race shoes, which in hindsight, were laced way too tight.  I could feel my feet going numb, and had to run with my toes splayed from time to time to fight off the cramps.


But as I hit the mile 20 marker, [this bop](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=c8B14pacww0) came on, which hardened my resolve to finish strong.


**Miles 21 - 26**


The feet problem got worse, and the numbness started creeping up my calf on the left.  Possibly a lingering side effect from the tendonitis?  Idk, but it was pretty fucked.


By the last mile, I felt like I was one of those Lord of the Dance performers–cue Chandler *""his legs flail about as if independent from his body!""*--and was barely holding the cramping at bay.  Threw my shoes off right after I crossed the finish line to give my feet more room to stretch. 


To absolutely no avail.  I spent the ensuing 10 minutes with my ass on the sidewalk while my spouse tried to keep my calf and foot from seizing up.




### Post-race and final notes


The tightness in my calf lingered the whole day following the race, as if I even looked at it funny, it would set off.  As I write this the morning after, nothing seems to be too out of the ordinary - so fingers crossed there won't be any lasting damage.


I realize that my time doesn't have enough buffer to qualify me for Boston, and I'm still trying to decide how I feel about it.  On the one hand, I have very little desire to arrange all the logistics and costs of traveling for a race, but on the other, I feel like it's something I should experience at least once?  There's always next year, I suppose.


**And lastly: can't wait to run again.  Taper is *boring* and I always feel like a lost little child not running my normal mileage.**



### Shout outs


To all the loved ones out there that abide by this lunacy - thank you for all your support.


To all the running subreddits out there, yes, even you, r/runningcirclejerk, for keeping me safe and sane. 


To the guy I paced behind for ~5 miles wearing the same shoes as I was.  Good on you for holding on to your trash and binning it properly.


And obviously, to all the volunteers and law enforcement out on the course keeping us from being mowed down by impatient drivers.



### Fuck yous


To the off leash dog walkers on the race course.  


To the line cutting ladies at the port-a-potties pre-race.  


Be better human beings.

I've been on a journey over the past year to qualify for Boston after missing my time by 7 seconds last November in Richmond, VA. That race was a highlight, with great scenes, great pacers and crowd support leading to a 17 minute PR for the day. I knew that a BQ was possible with a bit more training. Unfortunately, my next attempt in April of this year was derailed by bad pacing and a pretty bad cold a week before. I decided to give it one more shot for Boston 2025 at the Erie Marathon, a flat course with a decent shot at good weather. 

**Goals**

A: 3:05 (no), B: 3:10 (PR and BQ)(no), C: Strong mental game on race day, without giving into fear or pain (mostly yes)

https://preview.redd.it/z6kr2ztayznd1.png?width=715&format=png&auto=webp&s=b3378a61c778e6dfab1c8ca614d14bc1eb9e507e

**Training**

With 20 weeks between my April and September races, I believe I had an OK window for training. I took 5 weeks in May to gradually recover, getting back to 30 miles per week with slow runs. By June I was back into training mode with speed workouts, a few tempo runs, and long runs around 15 miles. The first few weeks weren’t great, but by the third week the speed had definitely returned and I felt good. Unfortunately, this was right when summer became intense and slowed me down dramatically. Even a few of the early 5:30AM workouts were sweltering in the warm humidity. Worst was a series of failed long tempo runs in July and August when it was just too hot to keep pace. I did a combo of treadmill runs and outdoors, but several in a row had to be cut short and finished with easy paces. This did not bode well, but I was hopeful that the increased difficulty would offset the shorter distances at goal pace. My overall training plan included alternating weeks of higher mileage with less intensity (peaking at 55-60 miles, which I hit 3 times) and shorter weeks with faster paces in my long runs (40-50 miles). I was feeling especially fit after my last two speed workouts.

**Pre-race**

Feeling confident about the weather, the heat training I had gone through, and most of the training results, I drove up to Erie to get ready. I’d followed a carb loading plan and was dealing with normal pre-race jitters, a bit of bloating, and some phantom pain in my calf, which made me nervous but also OK because I knew it was to be expected. The long drive didn’t help, but after packet pickup I did a 2 mile shakeout run on the course and was feeling good. Dinner was a seared fish with baked potato and rice as sides to top up the carbs and it was off to the hotel for an unrestful night’s sleep. I woke up in plenty of time to get bathroom issues settled and was ahead of schedule to the race, but a 30+ minute backup getting parked added unneeded stress to the morning. I got to the start line about 5 minutes before the gun went off and was set to go!

**Race**

The course is two loops around the pleasant Presque Isle State Park peninsula. It is perfectly flat (one bridge at around miles 7 and 20 was actually a pleasant change) and mostly shaded. The weather was just about perfect, lows 50s F at the start and not too much warmer by the end. The only poor condition was the wind, which was steady and strong coming off Lake Erie. Fortunately we were running perpendicular to it, and any headwind was countered by a tailwind on the opposite side of the course, so I don’t think that was a major factor. 

Edit: I'll also add that my favorite feature of the course was that there were water/gatorade stations every mile, which was made possible because the 2 loop course required only 13 total stations. The volunteers were great and the extra hydration and supplemental carbs when I wasn't taking a gel really helped I think.

My major strategic goal was to not go out too fast, after doing so by about 20 seconds/mile in my last race. Fortunately, I was able to rein myself in for 2 miles by going about 15 seconds slower than goal pace, which was exactly what I wanted to do. This gave me a lot of confidence and made the next several miles feel easy. For miles 3-19 I was almost perfectly on pace, plus or minus 5 seconds per mile. I was feeling the runner’s high and was running with joy. I loved it!

As is so often the case, mile 20 eventually came and I began to notice the fatigue. I stopped looking at my paces, mostly because I didn’t want the added stress. I knew I was slowing down, but I hoped it wasn’t by much. I was occasionally passing people at this point, though a few were passing me also, so I figured my slow down was fairly modest. The last 3 miles were tough. I pushed, but didn’t push hard enough. I had slowed to 7:30 and then 8 minutes/mile, but I didn’t know it, I was hoping that I was around 7:20-20. I managed to pick it back up to that pace in the last mile, and the finish line came into sight and I gladly pushed myself more for the finale quarter mile. As I neared the finish line, I saw the clock reading 3:11… and the dread started to sink in. My watch time ended up being spot on, at 3:11:10, a minute slower than last year and still a minute and 10 seconds away from my goal BQ.

**Next Steps**

I wasn’t too disappointed at first, but the disappointment has grown in the 2 days since the race. I can’t get over the feeling of wasting a year’s worth of training. My goal for the next few weeks is all mental: to find meaning in my effort. I feel stronger and faster, even though I haven’t proven that yet. There’s a cliche in a lot of running advice: that it is important to “find your why.” I want to demonstrate to myself that I can improve and that I can achieve tough things. I don’t think I have lost the joy through the training process, I still enjoy most of my runs and appreciate the efforts I have put in, even when tough or when they don’t go according to plan.

As for races: I will be running the excellent Disney Marathon in January, but am planning on using that as a long training run. My goal will be to incorporate that into training for another PR attempt in March by going slow, trying out the Galloway run-walk method with the pacers on course. I’m considering the Shamrock, One City, Tobacco Road, or Coast Guard Marathons in March. As for training, I’m going to weigh a few possibilities: focus more on nailing those long tempo runs, spending my off season getting serious about strength training (I’ve been semi-consistent for the past 6 months, perhaps hiring a trainer for a few months will help me level up there), or maybe try for higher mileage plans."

‘Sup Runnit, it’s been a minute. Okay, it’s been way more than a minute, it’s actually been a little over two years since I posted a race report. It’s not like I haven’t been racing, it’s just that I haven’t had any races where I had much to say about them.
  

  
Well, that isn’t entirely true either.
  

  
The truth of the matter is that after having a HUGE breakout in 2021 I felt like I was on fire and could take on the world, but first I wanted to run the Olympic Trials Qualifying time in the Marathon - which seemed like a simple enough task since I had run 2:16:51, but just didn’t do it within the OTQ window (1/22-12/23). However, the three times I ran a marathon since my last race report, basically I completely fell apart. Every time. At the same point. While I think that there’s value to reading a good race report about a race that didn’t go according to plan, I didn’t have the capacity to do something like that. In fact, if I did write a race report, it probably would have been so full of negativity, self-loathing, while also being a disgusting pity party that it was not going to have a net-positive impact to put out into the world.
  

  
Yes, this happened THREE times. The first was at Grandma’s marathon in 2022, then second was at CIM in 2022, and the third was at the Toledo marathon in 2023. To make a long story short, every time that I THOUGHT I had something figured out, it wasn’t the right piece.
  

  
So what was the right piece?
  

  
Well, there were certainly small training things here and there that got tweaked that I think made minor differences, which when shooting for an Olympic Trials Qualifying time CAN make a decent difference, but it wasn’t until my most recent blowup that I finally put the piece together: I wasn’t taking in enough calories during the marathon.
  

  
I vowed that for THIS training cycle I would practice nutrition, run big mileage to really hone in on being marathon specific, and be ready to run the standard on the exact same course where I ran 2:16:51 back in 2021. Not only was it the same course, but instead of it being a solo effort like last time, THIS time I would have a pack of 40-60 people all trying to chase the OTQ with pacers and everything.
  

  
Training went GREAT. I started a new job in a school district that operated on a 4-day week, and also just generally did WONDERS for my mental health. All of the pieces were coming together. Heading into race week I felt great. I was masking up at work for the two weeks prior to the race to prevent any sort of illness, I had all of my travel and whatnot planned out to a tee. I made it to New York from Colorado with no issues…
  

  
And then I woke up yesterday morning with a hacking cough, fever, and tight chest.
  

  
It was like I just saw 3.5 months worth of training slowly start to crumble before my eyes. The weather was going to be PERFECT the next day. I felt SO READY. Everything had fallen into place, but this one variable that I THOUGHT I could control was going to prevent me from having that perfect day. I called up my coach and we discussed pivoting to the Philadelphia marathon or something similar, but once we were finished with that conversation, we shifted to still trying to give tomorrow a good shot. After all, we figured I was in MUCH better than OTQ shape, so maybe even if I felt 90% there I could still grind it out. I slept most of the day and drank as many fluids with electrolytes as I could, took vitamin C, the works. Went to bed nice and early, although I had trouble falling asleep due to spending most of the day resting and maybe got 6 hours.
  

  
I woke up feeling okay. Not great, but okay. Okay enough that I figured I might as well give it a shot. After all, my coach said that I might as well take this opportunity to run at sea level, get in a good effort, and if nothing else it would be a good way to get in a nice, hard workout before the next race should I need it. The warm routine and whatnot goes off as normal, I make it to the line. My bottles are ready from dropping them off the day prior. I line up with the pack that is gonna try to chase the OTQ, and we’re off.
  

  
Now even with a bit of sickness, I figured that I’d have no problem at least making it halfway or so. Picked up all of my bottles without a problem, took my gels at the right time, but began to realize something: not only was I making it to the halfway point okay, but it actually felt pretty easy, almost boring. I saw that we were well on pace, 68:45ish through the half, but still knew that as far as the marathon goes, this really wasn’t the TRUE halfway point. The course was composed of 2.97 mile loops, and I knew that the REAL test would come somewhere around 2-3 laps to go. So for the next two laps leading up to that point I simply repeated the mantra that my coach had given me to think about during the race.
  

  
“Calm and patient, calm and patient”
  

  
And I was calm and patient! My pace stayed ROCK steady right at 5:15/5:14/mile just staying right up near the front of the pack, but I knew that the pacer was only going to \~17 miles, and those last 9 were the hardest 9 of the race. So as we neared that point I prepared myself to be ready to take the pace if needed - but I didn’t need to. Thankfully several other racers who were feeling even better than me started to surge ahead and string things out a little bit. So I just settled in and once again thought to myself “calm and patient, calm and patient”. Early on in the race I had given up on looking at my watch for splits, since it seemed the GPS was running a bit fast, so I just focused on keeping the perceived effort the same. “Calm and patient, calm and patient”.
  

  
Heading into two laps to go was where it became real.
  

  
There was a sign by the finish line that we passed by every lap that told you the exact time you had to be on/faster than to be on pace for an OTQ, and with two laps to go I saw that I was almost 30 seconds ahead of that pace. “This was the exact point where in all three of my last marathons that things started to fall apar… calm and patient, calm and patient” that thought immediately got shoved to the back of my head, never to be thought of again. Instead the very real possibility that I was about to hit my goal started to enter my head, but at the same time, anything could happen in the last 10k of a marathon, so if there was ever a time to really dial in on my mantra it was right now. So for the next 3 miles all that went through my head was either nothing, or, “calm and patient”. It started to drizzle, but I didn’t mind.
  

  
Entering the last lap, I knew I had it. Everything in my body was telling me I had the strength to make it 3 more miles on pace. Was it going to be easy? No, but it was going to happen. I didn’t speed up, I didn’t slow down. I ran the exact same pace that I had run for the past two hours, knowing that it would take me straight to my goal.
  

  
And it did.
  

  
Unlike last time where I wanted to run as fast as possible I didn’t care about my time as long as it was under 2:18:00, so once I saw the clock and knew for a fact I had it in the bag I simply started to scream. I kept screaming until I made it to my parents, both of whom were there to support me, despite knowing I was feeling horrible the day before. With all of the adrenaline in the world coursing through my veins, I did the only thing I could do in that moment - sit down and cry like a baby. I cried until all of the cumulative stress that I had put on myself over the past two years was completely purged from my body. Every single “you’re no good enough” “you’ve already run the time, why haven’t you been able to do it again” “you should quit” “you should give up” all flooded out and mixed into the now combined puddles of emotions and rainwater around me.
  

  
I still can’t believe that out of all the times I tried, THIS was the time when it happened. I felt so horrible yesterday, and came into the race with my doubts about how I was going to do, but somehow pushed all of those doubts aside and came through. Maybe if I wasn’t sick I could have run fast, maybe I wasn’t as ill as I thought I was. At this point I couldn’t care less. What I do know is two things: this was the best mental game I’ve ever had during a race, and this was the best nutrition plan I took during a race.
  

  
A quick bit of technicals:
  

  
\-During the race I took \~1040 calories: 2xmaurten 320 and .5xmaurten 160 divided into 8 bottles, 2xgel 100 caf 100, 1x gel 100. Caf gels at 7 and 17, regular gel at 14, the bottles were every \~3 miles.
  
\-Training: biggest week - 130ish (140 highest 7-day average), lots of a variation, probably an average of \~105/week for the whole cycle if I had to ballpark it
  
\-Very little taper - three weeks before race week were 101, 80 in 6 days, 80 in 7 days, then race week.
  
\-Strength training - none, I’ve done it with other cycle, but we just didn’t do any lifting or other sorts of exercises during this cycle
  

  
I’ve been so fortunate to have so many people support me through my big slump, and I’ve finally come out of it with a renewed source of confidence, and a much better attitude overall towards the sport. Thanks if you made it this far, I know it’s a lot, but I wasn’t gonna go halfway on this one with how meaningful it is for me.
  

  
I’ll let you know how things go in Orlando - peace.

# Training

This was an unusual block in that I decided four months out to prioritise a 100km road race (my first ultra) scheduled 7 weeks before the marathon. The basic weekly training structure didn't change, but the long runs got longer (up to 55km on Sunday and 25km for the mid-week medium-long run) and I dropped most of the doubles in favour of recovery. Mileage ahead of the 100km peaked at about 155km/week, and despite really warm temps on the day, the race went better than I could have dreamed (report here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1iwq2ib/marathoner\_tries\_an\_ultra\_report\_and\_observations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1iwq2ib/marathoner_tries_an_ultra_report_and_observations/) )

I'd pulled up pretty well after a week, so I decided to commit to the marathon, and was back to full training (although still without doubles) a fortnight after the ultra. Sessions were challenging initially in that I felt fine aerobically, but the legs were lacking power to hit my usual paces.

The four weeks of solid training before a short (10 day) taper were 120km, 115km, 110km and 105km. Key marathon pace workouts in this period included 2 x 10km, 3 x 5km, a 36km long run with 10km @ MP and a 35km run incorporating an informal pacing gig for an 88 min HM.

Altogether it was the least volume and intensity I'd put into a marathon build, and I knew I wasn't in shape to beat my 2:43 PR from the same race the previous year. I tentatively set my sights on a 2:45 goal (PR from 2 years prior) with a focus on trying to maintain even splits. Without the pressure of trying to hit a new best, the taper period felt much more relaxed and I slept better as a result.

# Pre-race

All felt very straightforward. A 15 min drive from home to the start line, all the nutrition and hydration worked out from previous outings, and into the priority start along with some friends and club mates just prior to the gun. The weather was good: 12-13 C at the start with only light winds.

A change for this race, based on learnings from the 100km, was increased carb and fluid intake, aiming for 6 x 250ml bottles of drink mix (90g carbs) plus 210g carbs in Precision gels. This all went down just fine.

# Race

There was the usual sorting out of packs over the first 5km, and I focused on keeping things very controlled (this involved deliberately falling behind a bunch of small groups; very unusual for me). I had a friend on a bike handing me bottles at different points which was a huge help, and I hit a couple of the drink stations for water and cups-over-the-head cooling as well.

The biggest hill on course is at 13km, and in hindsight I pushed slightly too hard (caught up in my stupid every km sub 4 goal), but otherwise pacing seemed fine, and the group of 5 or 6 runners I was in by 10km stayed together working really well together until 33km

Things got hard by 35km as it was warming up and the legs were starting to tire. I tried to stay relaxed and told myself repeatedly that I'd done this plenty of times before. This helped get through the final hill without slowing too much.

I definitely didn't have a kick to the finish (although partly I think I just wasn't invested enough to go right to the wall), but managed not to bleed too much time, and come in right where I'd hoped at 2:45 (2 mins slower than my PB, and just 2 seconds off my time from the year prior).

# Post-race

Drinks and chats with friends, then I jumped in an ice-bath provided by the organisers - it was excruciating, and I was back out in 30 seconds (a few guys in the other baths by contrast looked like they were in a jacuzzi!)

My family had come down to the finish as well. My pre-teen kids were pretty unimpressed with watching Dad roll in, but they were super excited seeing some kids sprint to the finish in the 5km event, and as soon as we were back home they were begging me to go running with them in practice for their upcoming school XC! (we compromised - I kept company on the bike).

Beyond that I felt happy that I'd managed a decent time off an interrupted and relatively low-key prep, and also that I'd managed to nail the planning, pacing and nutrition.

I've now had two weeks with almost no running at all - a much longer break than previous marathons - and not sure what's next. There's part of me still keen to lower the PR (sub 2:40 has been the aim for a while), but part of me shudders at the thought of another all-in training block for what are very much diminishing returns at this stage and age in my running journey.

Maybe instead I'll keep experimenting with ultras. Or perhaps it'll be enough just to try and keep up with my kids as they keep getting faster seemingly after every 20-minute training run!

### Training

I was hoping to beat my 1 mile PR of 4:51, which was set this year in June, at an outdoor meet. Some prior context is that I'm a regular basketball player who plays multiple nights a week in a men's league, so I'm not a very high-mileage runner. After my mile race in June, I took it easy for a few months before starting some more systematic training around September-ish. I ended up running a significant 5k PR on Thanksgiving in 17:33 ([race report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1h21pee/race_report_turkey_trot_5k_breakthrough_pr_into/)) and wanted to utilize that fitness for another mile PR attempt. 

This was a bit different from the buildup to my summer mile race, because I had been focused on the mile for quite some time prior to that race, and ended up doing some tweaking to get where I needed. By contrast, this was a 1-month sharpening after a successful 5k training block. I wouldn't say the sharpening went ideal, as there were some minor obstacles: I dealt with a bit of a cold post-Thanksgiving, weather was tough for track workouts (35-40F, track often kinda wet), went on a 5-day vacation in mid-December, and the last week before the race had no track access due to heavy snow. 

Key workouts: I did some key workouts focusing on sub-4:50 paces, but to be honest, was not really hitting like I wanted to. Early in the sharpening, I tried to do a couple workouts with 4k of goal-pace work: 8x400 + 4x200; 4x600 + 8x200. In that second workout, I fell off pace on the last couple 600s pretty badly, but told myself that weather + sickness were serious factors. As the race got closer, focused on workouts with lower overall volume but at least one 800 rep, like 800+600+400 with some 200 repeats at the end. Final hard workout was 8 days out: 6x400m with strict 1 minute recovery. Aiming for 72 seconds (4:48 pace) and mostly hit my paces, with a too fast first rep (67-ish), and slightly slow on the last couple reps (73-even). Last week was easy jogs on the roads with some short strides/bursts to focus on leg speed.

### Race

The race was an open meet with multiple heats, so I ran with a mix of high-schoolers and adult recreational runners like myself. There were multiple heats ordered by time, and I was in 6th position for my heat with an entered time of 4:50, so anticipated some people running a little quicker. I went out towards the back/middle of the pack, unsure of exactly what to expect given the up-and-down sharpening period and a week of stuffing my face around Christmas. 

The story of the race is generally in the splits above: went out at a solid pace, but the race slowed a bit in the middle stages. With about 400m to go, I realized I had some juice left and needed to get a move on if I wanted to meet my goal. Moved up from 6th to 2nd with a 35-second lap (200m indoor track), then turned it up with a 33.6 final 200m to pass the guy ahead of me and win my heat in 4:49.76, beating my 4:51 PR and barely sneaking in under the 4:50 mark.

###Post Race

Feeling very happy with the race and the PR, given the uneven final month of training. It reinforced my confidence in knowing my abilities, and also highlighted the benefits of racing in better conditions: definitely ran a lot faster in a race setting compared to solo, plus climate-controlled temps and wearing race spikes for shoes (I do all my workouts in trainers). Maybe could've run even faster with pushing the pace a bit in those middle laps.

TBD what's next - had been telling myself I'll leave the mile behind to focus on longer distances, but when I keep on improving, makes me want to do more!"

Disclaimer: this is my opinion and I'm checking if the sentiment exists with the majority here. 

About 50% of posts here have become race reports (granted it's marathon season). While it's great that so many people are running, I feel like these walls of text and the hundreds of congrats replies are overwhelming the feed of ""AdvancedRunning"", essentially turning it into Strava (which I also use and love). Do others feel the same way? 

Personally, unless they are elite reports or very unique, I skip (I couldn't find a filter function on Reddit). I recognize that maybe the rest of this community disagrees with me, hence the open question.

One idea would be to move the reports to a thread, like the weekly achievements.
Alternatively post them in another designated subreddit. 

Cheers!

Edit: wow what a response! Seems like a lot of people are on the same boat as me, but not the overwhelming majority. Trying to be neutral, here's a rundown of the themes in the responses:

- The threshold for a ""worthy post"" is unbalanced. Anything goes for a race report, but other questions get easily blocked.

- Race reports are too f- long (OK, I wasn't neutral there).

- A lot of people enjoy the individual experiences written and like the write-ups. Useful for preparing for the same race as the report.

- Reducing the amount race reports could cause this subreddit to plateau/die.

- ""Just skip the posts, bro""

- Megathreads for major races: some think they'd inhibit discussion, others (like myself) would prefer them.

# Training

I’ve trained consistently well over the last 10 months, averaging more than 60 km per week. In early March, I signed up for the Copenhagen Marathon and began specific marathon training. I already had a solid base with 60–80 km per week since January, but lacked runs longer than 15 km.

On March 8, I ran a local 10 km and achieved a strong PB with a time of 35:30. The course wasn’t exactly easy either, with about 100 meters of elevation. I gradually increased my long runs from 22 km, adding about 5 km each week. My longest run was 31 km, and I did a total of three runs over 30 km. Every other long run was hard, with segments at marathon pace or faster.

I also gradually built up the intervals, doing sessions like 5x2000 meters with 800 meters easy recovery. I included some workouts like 5+5+5 km or 6+6+6 km with an average pace around marathon pace. I had four weeks over 90 km, with the highest week being 97 km.

Four weeks before the race, I felt sudden pain in my foot during a hard long interval session. The pain was on the outer side of the foot, and I struggled to put weight on it. I was 99% sure it was an overuse injury, possibly a stress fracture. But it turned out to be “just” cuboid syndrome, where the cuboid bone was partially out of place. In consultation with a doctor, I decided to take a full week off running and only did cross-training on the elliptical and Jacob’s Ladder.

I was pain-free five days after the injury, and on day six I ran 8 easy km without pain. I gradually ramped up training and managed to run 84 km the week 3 weeks before the race. My final easy long run of 30 km was two weeks out, and I began tapering after that.

The final full week before the marathon, I logged 50 km. One week before the race, I did 5x2000 m with 800 m easy, where the reps were slightly faster than marathon pace (a total of 15 km at roughly marathon pace). During this session, I realized I couldn’t use the Vaporfly 3 for the race because it was too tight and put pressure on my arch. I had to urgently order the Adidas Adios Pro 4, which turned out to be amazing to run in.

During race week, I ran a total of 18 km before the marathon. The final interval session was on Wednesday: 4x1200 meters with active recovery.

# The Race

The Copenhagen Marathon is very well organized. It’s easy to pick up your race bib, and it would have been completely possible to show up just 30 minutes before the start to check your bag and get to the start line. I took the metro to the start area, but it was completely packed—so I later regretted not using a rental bike instead.

I had submitted a predicted finish time under 3 hours, so I was placed in the yellow corral just behind the elite. I positioned myself in the middle of the corral and was able to get into my goal pace straight away without any crowding.

When I ran in London, I felt like I was stuck in a crowd for the first half and couldn’t hold my pace. The plan was to hold a 4:05/km pace and only pick it up after 30 km if I felt good. The pace felt right—maybe even a bit too easy early on—but I didn’t want to push and risk blowing the sub-3, which was the main goal.

Not until after 30 km did I start to feel it in the muscles, but at no point did I struggle to maintain the pace. The infamous marathon wall never came. I decided not to increase the pace before 35 km at the earliest, in fear of blowing up.

At 35 km, I did the math and realized I wouldn’t get under 2:50 anyway, so I might as well cruise to a 2:53 finish comfortably. I increased the pace slightly in the last 2 km and crossed the line in 2:52:42. It was a fantastic experience.

I probably could have gone sub-2:50 that day if I had paced it right from the start—but there’s always a risk of a muscular crash near the end. So I’m glad I went with the safe strategy.

# Post-race

completely stiffened up in my legs after crossing the finish line and hobbled over to the baggage claim. To my great surprise, I had no blisters or chafing, neither on my feet nor anywhere else. Four days after the race, I feel nothing in my legs and feel ready to run again. The next goal is sub 2:45, this time with more solid long runs in the bag!"

**TLDR:** Sportsplex meets are rough but bring a 41 year-old personal glory.

**Training**

Brief History: I’m 41 years old now.  I loved the mile in grade school (grade 1 – 7) because I never ran any longer than a mile, played other sports, then smoked everyone once a year.  I think my PR was 6:08 in 7^(th) grade. Also won the county in the 400 in track in 6^(th) grade and 600 in track in 7^(th) grade.

Fast forward 27 years. At some point I decided my goal was a 5 minute mile and at one point in my late twenties, I probably ran 12 miles a week on the treadmill including a few pyramid runs, then injured myself and gave up.  I also somehow gave myself such terrible ITBS in my mid-30s from biking to work and sitting at my desk that I could not straighten my leg past 90 degrees for two months and got exploratory surgery which, basically, told me I was fine.  I picked up running as a way to tame my ITBS and, one day after getting lost before work and needing to run fast to find my way home, I realized I didn’t actually mind running longer distances.  So I followed the Higdon basic 2 plan, ran a marathon, by myself, on a bike trail in florida in 3:54 minutes.

In the beginning of 2024, while living in Nigeria where running is impossible, I was bored out of my mind and set myself a goal of a 1:30 half marathon on a treadmill.  I overtrained a bit, got some niggles, a strained calf, but put in 770 miles in 6 months, by far my most ever, and ran a treadmill 10k in 39:40.

Moved back to the States, joined a club, in September, and have been super consistent since then, slowly ramping up to 40mpw by the end of October, and now having a last 3-month period that looks like a straight line of consistency on my strava graph.   

From Sep – Dec, I was doing 3 workouts a week: intervals, a (probably too fast) tempo, and a long run, which most of the time was progressive or had some quality in it. Since mid-december, I’ve been mostly doing 3 subthreshold sessions per week; my last week, for example, was 4\*2000 @ 6:35, 7\*800 @ 3:11, and 25\*400 @ 1:32.

**Pre-race**

PG Sportsplex races are odd.  First off, there is no schedule.  It’s a low-cost event, so whoever shows up and pays can run.  They run Masters/Kids in the morning, then high school/open in the afternoon.  I’d run it twice before.  The first time I ran with the masters, who, while inspiring, were also all 20+ years older than me and I lapped them all at least twice.  I was also told that, when they didn’t have enough Masters in the previous meet, they combined their mile run with the under 10 children.  This made me pause.  If you haven’t watched children under 10 run a mile, it is amazing.  There are basically 2 phases: the first 100 meters, where they all sprint, then the last 1500 meters, where they slowly drag around the track. 

I didn’t like the idea of chasing down 8 year olds, so the next time I went to the meet I entered the open race. Unfortunately, it was so chaotic that I had to wait in line for 1.5 hours, then on the track for another 2.5 hours just to do my race, which I was happy to run in a 5:06 with a lot left at the end for a kick.  I knew 5:00 was in sight, and I had 4 races left on the indoor calendar in which to do it, so I decided to go for the masters race again to avoid the lines.

For breakfast I had – oh wait, it’s a mile, it really doesn’t matter.  I had two espressos though, and had a caffeine pill in my shorts that I planned to take an hour before the race.

Showed up 1 hour 45 minutes before the masters mile took place the first time I ran, but, as I stood at the registration table, I saw an ominous sign: young children dragging their heels running around the track.  I knew there was only one event before the mile: the 55m.  I asked the desk and they confirmed—yes, the mile heats were starting, and of course, they had for some reason started the meet earlier today (I later met another master’s miler who showed up 20 minutes after the race ended and looked disappointed), probably because the commanders (JD5!) are in the NFC championship at 3pm and none of the staff wants to miss the game in order to run countless heats of middle school sprints.

Fortunately, when I squinted I noticed the kids dragging around the track were all girls, and there was a small group of 9 year old boys milling aimlessly near the track.  That meant I had 10 minutes.  And a decision—should I risk injury and run with pretty much no warmup (remember, I am 41) or just call it a day and do some subthreshold running. Luckily, my normal warmup routine for my track workouts is terrible because I pull myself out of bed at the last possible minute and am lucky if I manage a mile jog before getting to the track, so I told myself this would be no different and hey, you only live once.  I raced to the bathroom, changed, got a drink, hid my bag under the bleachers, ran about a 600 m warmup outside, wove my way running through hordes of children warming up, and then finally tracked down the dude with the clipboard who had the name tags.  One minute before gun time, I got to the start line, did a few desperate stretches, and took my position.

**Race**

My plan was to hold 37 second 200s.  I know I can kick.  I had no time to even see who I was racing against, so just set my watch to track mode and started with the gun.

Checked my watch after the first 409, and it was about 1:12, so I went pretty hot.  At that point, I regretted never having trained at that pace and having no idea what it felt like.  But I did know what my legs felt like, and that was lactate-y, which was a big change from my 5:06 race when I felt pretty great throughout.

At 800, I think the time was 2:26, so I knew I had banked a few seconds, but my legs were feeling real heavy. Seriously debated just stepping off the track and blaming fate.  But kept going.

Somehow made it to the final lap with 38/39 seconds to spare.  Felt real poor, but if all I gotta do is kick for 200 meters to achieve a lifetime goal, I can do that.  Crossed the finish line at 4:59.1.  Gave some random dude a fist bump then lay on the ground off the side of the track like an Olympian for 10 minutes.

**Post-race**

Glory.  Texted my friend, who had never quite run that fast in high school but had given me the inspirational advice that I would do better if I “run faster, and even better if you run even faster.”

The best part is I never have to participate in PG Sportsplex races again.  Not next week.  Not ever.  Thank you and goodbye PG sportsplex.

**Afterwards**

My HR was high as hell! Maybe this was a hallucination by garmin, but it showed 10bpm faster than I had ever seen before.  Then again I had never put forward an effort quite this hard before.  I have a VO2max test at a clinic next week that I’ve been postponing forever, so will be able to confirm."

# Training

I ran my first marathon in November and living in Michigan I took a lot of the winter off and transitioned back to playing soccer and hitting the gym a few times per week each. I ran a few more times in December and January before the weather got miserable, but I didn't really begin my training for the half until the first week of March, which was 10 weeks out from the Flying Pig. I felt that I had a decent base-level of fitness to call upon so I cut out the first 3 weeks of Hal Higdon's novice Half Marathon plan (I'd followed his full plan leading up to my full marathon in November). I modified some distances slightly to give myself more mileage leading up to the half marathon.

So I started training the first week of March and it took a long time for running to actually feel good again. I started out going too fast, muscle tightness during and after runs, the cold often made it feel like a chore. I was also still doing some heavy workouts in the gym and playing soccer two nights per week so I felt exhausted all the time and was doing too much. Regardless, I hit 7 weeks in a row, running 4x per week and completing every run, most of the time wondering where the running high was and wondering what I had to do to feel that way again. Most of it wasn't fun. I told myself I probably needed a break from running after the race. 

I stopped my gym routine and cut down to 1 night of soccer about 3 weeks before the race, and what do you know, running started to feel better. As I finished peak week of training (25 miles, long run was 12) I was feeling really good - I absolutely crushed my 12 mile training run that included the biggest hills I could find around here. In that same week my short run was 3 miles and I set a 1-mile PR on my third mile, so I was feeling really confident.

Had a one-week taper planned out where I would drop my weekly mileage down, but I got sick that week and was only able to do a 6-mile and 3-mile run. Even with those I was probably going faster than I should've. 

Race week went well - I had a 4-mile, 3-mile, and 2-mile training run at a relaxed pace before 72 hours off leading up to the race. I ate a bunch of pasta and bread and went to bed super excited! Pretty different from my first race (the Philadelphia in November) where I remember feeling quite nervous. I felt really confident and felt like I had a chance of smashing my stretch goal of 1:50:00 if things went well. 

# Pre-race

Woke up at 4 AM to take care of my normal morning pre-run routines - Tailwind, water, coffee, toast, stretching, bathroom. My fiance drove us to downtown Cincinnati and I got dropped off a few minutes before 5:30. 

Paycor Stadium (where the start line was) was a zoo! No security (unlike Philly), with plenty of spectators and fans, dogs, pigs, and runners all intermixed. Getting there was easy and didn't take nearly as much time as I'd thought, so I was about an hour early.

Nervous energy started to build - tried to keep calm with some stretching but my HR monitor had me resting at around 88 bpm, about 2x as much as my normal resting HR. It's about 60 degrees, overcast, but it had rained the day before and the atmosphere felt heavy. 

I'm in the third corral toward (""pig pen"") toward the back. After the national anthem it's 6:30am and the first runners are released. We start walking up toward the finish line and about 3 minutes before starting a wave of tiredness hits me - I yawn, my legs feel weak, I'm thinking ""what is going on"" but it's probably just more pre-race nervousness and I try to brush it off. The last 30 meters before the start line opens up and everybody starts jogging, the flames are going overhead and we're off!

# Race

The Flying Pig half marathon is hilly. There's some small ones as you cross the bridges from Ohio to Kentucky and back in the first 4 miles, but then miles 5 through 10 there are 3 significant uphill portions with about 330 feet of climbing. There's some downhill in there too, but in my mind it's a 10-mile run and I can afford to work hard those first 10 miles knowing the last 3 will have fans, plenty of downhill, and the impending finish swine. 

As soon as I cross the start line I start to think ""I'm not sure if I feel up for this today."" I wonder if it's going to be one of those days where you're just not at your best - but I felt like this at the start of the Philly Marathon too and I tell myself it will pass.

I see my fiance and a friend about a half mile in and that's always nice. We're headed around The Great American Ballpark and then across the bridge into Kentucky. It's warm. It feels warmer than 62 degrees. Part of it is the crowd, but it's definitely warm. 

The first 3-4 miles were much tougher than I wanted them to be. I knew miles 6-10 were some significant, tough uphills, so I found myself worrying about those quite a lot, and I knew I had to keep some gas in the tank to get through that. My first mile was 20 seconds slower than I wanted it to be, but miles 2-5 were on the right pace for me. The humidity and heaviness of the air was concerning - I was sweating far more than I was used to, having trained in mostly cool or chilly weather. I was drinking more water, and earlier, than I had intended to. I ate one of my Huma gels around 3.5 miles in. There was more than one moment where I felt like walking. 

Mile 4-5 was through downtown - super crowded with fans, the sun coming through the buildings, and I saw my fiance and buddy again and all of that was actually pretty nice, but all I could think about was the upcoming hills.

We get to the base of Mt. Adams, first hill - plenty of people ahead of and around me are walking. However, miles 5-8 slid by smoothly. Mt. Adams is a lovely area, with beautiful parks, hills, museums, conservatories, nice neighborhoods, plenty of fans, and some nice shaded areas with a cool, very welcome breeze. I had a good time and I was crushing these hills, mostly hitting the pace I planned for. I took another Huma gel at 7 miles and plowed up the second big hill. 

Around 8 or 8.5 I started to struggle again and it felt like I was running out of gas. This is not really reflected on my split times, but I was probably going faster than I should've gone. Sometimes when you've been running hills and it flattens out, you just can't help yourself but go faster. Rookie mistake? Had one last hill to conquer before topping out in Mt. Adams around 9.5 or 10 miles, and I made it through it before taking my last Huma gel. 

10 miles in and you start to go downhill, and it feels really good at that point. I'd lost a lot of sweat and water going up those hills and the water stations helped a lot to catch my breath a bit and heading downhill was just fantastic. I sped up, caught my breath, even lowered my HR a bit on these huge downhills as we headed back in to the city. 

It flattens out again for miles 11, 12, and 13.1 and those were tough miles. In particular that last mile felt like a long mile but I pushed through to the finish line! Strava tells me I ran 13.58 miles - if you've read this far, do you think the course is marked wrong or Strava/iPhone tracking is incorrect? If Strava is correct, I beat my PR half-marathon time by over 4 minutes. If it's incorrect, I beat my previous half-marathon PR by 10 seconds 🤣

# Post-race

About 2 minutes after I cross the finish line, I get a text saying ""the course is red flagged, runners are encouraged to listen to their bodies and slow their pace."" Made sense - I had seen 4 or 5 runners passed out, getting medical attention, others cramping up... not a great sight. 

I got my medal, a banana, a bottle of water, and met up with my fiance and friends for some photos. That meetup after the race is everything and feels so so good. 

I thought after running a marathon, a half would be pretty easy. I went into it feeling really great and like I had not had perfect training, but that I had done enough. I'm happy that I hit my first goal and even beat my PR,  but I think the weather/humidity really sapped me (and other runners) and made a tough course even more challenging. On another day I think I can break 1:55 or even 1:50, but I'm pretty happy to be done and taking a few days/weeks off to rest and recuperate. 

Thanks for reading if you've come this far! Congrats to all the other Flying Pig finishers and I hope you had a successful race 👍

### Training
I'd say officially training for this started in November of 2019. In August of 2019 I ran a 3:48 in the Mexico City Marathon (my first). I had a roughly 3:30 pace going into mile 20 but bonked super hard and ran/walk the last 10k bringing my average time up significantly. Overall I was disappointed and basically immediately afterwards started plotting my revenge. I had been training based on a rough version of the FIRST method (run 3 days a week, cross train 2, 40 MPW peak, 30 MPW normally) although I was running 2 of the 3 days at a moderate pace to avoid bringing back some nagging shin splints.

I picked up a copy of 80/20 Running by Matt Fitzgerald and decided to give his advice a spin. I bought a chest heart rate monitor and started using it every single run. I based my zones off a 30 minute Lactate Threshold test although it seemed unreasonably high (181 bpm) so I reduced it down to 174 so the zones felt right to me. Eventually I picked up a copy of Advanced Marathoning by Pete Pfitzinger and worked his advice into my schedule. I based most of my weekly schedule this year off the ideas in his book.

In November I very cautiously added an easy 4th day of running, then a 5th day of running. In December I added a 6th day of running and hit my first 50 mile week. January of this year I hit my first 60 mile week. In March I hit my first 70 mile week. It caused a minor injury which made me back off April but by the end of May I had hit my first 80 mile week. June and July I logged ~300 miles each month and August was 331, peaking at 85 miles one week. I was also doing a decent amount of trail running, typically logging between 5000-9000 feet of elevation gain a week.

I've never run doubles, only singles. Here's what my typical weekly schedule has looked likethis year:

* Monday: Long run (16-22 miles) (Zone 2 usually)
* Tuesday: Recovery run (6-10 miles) (Zone 1)
* Wednesday: Tempo/Threshold run or sometimes interval workout (8-13 miles)
* Thursday: General Endurance run (8-11 miles) (Zone 2)
* Friday: Medium-Long run (13-16 miles) (Zone 2)
* Saturday: Recovery run (6-10 miles) (Zone 1)
* Sunday: Usually a rest day. Easy run on 80+ mile weeks (0-10 miles) (Zone 1)

The last 4 months before my race I was working on a modified version of Pfitzenger's 70-85 mpw 18 week plan. I changed it to fit my schedule and only ran singles. I tried to hit the key workouts in his plan. The 12 miles @ marathon pace run immediately after my first 85 mile week was rough, as were some of the threshold runs in the middle of heavy mileage weeks.

I ran an unofficial 37:01 10k about 4 weeks before my marathon which made me feel good. 3 weeks before the race I fairly easily ran my 20 mile long run at a 7:30 min/mile pace which also made me feel good. Still, with 2 weeks remaining my long run was brutally bad and overall I wasn't sure what to expect on race day at all.

TL;DR: Was running ~33 MPW in 2019. Started heart rate training and eventually running 70-85 MPW in 2020 with a weekly long run and threshold run as my primary workout focuses.

### Pre-race
I followed the taper plan from the Pfitzenger plan but it was absolutely brutal and I was borderline depressed, especially considering the air was completely filled with smoke and I couldn't see the sun for a week. I was running in a face mask that filters down to 0.1 microns. Miraculously everything cleared up a day before the race. Before the race I just ate a Bobo's Oat bar and 15 minutes before the race a gel. I did a 5 minute easy jog to marathon pace warm up. I took some Imodium before the start of the race to prevent stomach issues I had last marathon.

### Race
My nutrition plan was to eat a gel with 100 calories and 50 mg of caffeine every 30 minutes of the race. I took a couple sips of water at almost every aid station except for the last 10k when I couldn't bring myself to slow down for fear of not being able to speed back up.

Almost immediately out the gate I was running by myself. There were 250 people in this marathon and I only passed 1 person and was only passed by 1 person. The first 5 miles I wanted to start off easy but not lose too much time. I honestly wasn't sure what I was capable of and was pretty worried about going out too strong. I definitely wanted to break 3 hours but would have been happy breaking 3:05 as well. I was a little worried to see that my heart rate was up to 161 by the end of mile 5 which already puts me into low Zone 3.

Miles 5-10 are steadily uphill and I was just trying to not lose too much time but also not try too hard. My heart rate climbed up to 164.

Mile 11 was flat then miles 12-17 dropped 800 feet which was a huge relief and also ridiculously beautiful. My heart rate recovered some as I gained a bunch of time.

Mile 20 was my biggest concern. Would I bonk like last time or would Pfitzenger carry me on the wings of an angel to the finish? By this point my heart rate was up to 176 which is into Zone 4. 80/20 Running describes this as ""I feel like I can keep this up for 15-20 minutes."" I still have 40 more minutes to run so I'm concerned but feel weirdly ok.

Mile 23: I'm happy that I haven't bonked yet. It's almost like I can't even feel my legs anymore. I'm ridiculously tired but somehow I keep running. My heart rate is 180 which is supposed to be ""The pace you can keep up for 1 mile, no more."" When I do mile repeats I usually average 175 bpm. I basically never get up to 180. The next 3 miles seem impossible but I keep going.

Mile 25/26: I really, really want this to end. I think how disappointed I would be in myself if I even let up the gas a tiny amount. I'm focusing on my breathing and digging as deep as possible. My watch says 186 BPM which is well into Zone 5 and almost my max heart rate (193).

Final stretch: One final turn, one tiny steep downhill that I almost fall on because I have very little control of my legs anymore. I see the finish line and know relief is in sight. I see the time and can't believe it. I push super hard to try to break 2:58 and pass the finish line at 2:57:57.

### Post-race
Banana, chocolate milk, and collapse in some grass. Almost 2 weeks later and I'm still recovering. I took a week off running and a week off work (mostly to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday) and went hiking in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national park almost every day. I don't feel any kind of injury or anything but it's crazy how slow I'm running right now.

Overall I've been wanting to break 3 hours and also get a Boston Qualifying marathon time for years so this is a huge win for me. My goal now is to get back up to 70+ MPW and do this all over again. I'm mostly curious to see what's even possible for me. Getting up to 90-100 MPW in the next training cycle would be cool if I can do it without getting injured.

### Additional info
I never foam roll or strength train. The only additional work I do is hiking on the weekends and Jay Johnson's pre-run warm up and post-run SAM cooldown workouts.
I never eat before running, even long runs.

\### Training

I started working with a coach just about a year ago, coming off of my second half marathon feeling discouraged, burnt out, and frustrated after dealing with an injury in the weeks leading up to the race. I knew even this time last year that I wanted to run the New York City Marathon.  I wanted to learn how to train the right way, as I honestly had no idea what I was doing. In March, I hit a 5K PR of 22:30. In April, I was able to shave 4 minutes off of my half marathon time, coming in at 1:49:14. I had a great training cycle for that race with no injuries, and was really feeling confident and looking forward to training for the marathon. I was able to follow the entire training plan with no issues (other than the last 3 weeks..). I never had any trouble on my long runs. Did a lot of speedwork and threshold work, along with easy runs. I was able to hit my goal marathon pace in my workouts with ease. I locked down what I felt was a good nutrition strategy, as I never experienced any bonking, muscle cramping, or anything like that. I really focused on my recovery, stretching, and foam rolling. I was doing strength training 5 days a week and cross training with cycling. I also specifically did a LOT of hill training, especially in the middle of/at the end of my long runs, as I knew New York was hilly and I really wanted to be as prepared as possible. I typically look for ways to avoid hills when I'm running, but forced myself to get used to them.  I was feeling pretty confident that a sub 4 would be hard, but possible for me. I peaked around 43 miles per week and averaged around 32-35 miles per week.

About 3 weeks out from the race, I felt the familiar signs of something I had before..posterior tibial tendonitis. This time, in my other foot. The first time I had it, I was able to keep it at bay doing some exercises my coach provided and applying some heat to it. I was able to continue running. But I wasn't running nearly as much mileage as I was this time. I didn't want to take any chances so I headed straight to my PT. She advised me to cut back on my mileage in the weeks leading up to the race. I was nervous, but I knew the work had already been done. It started feeling better until I attempted a 10 mile run one week out (with her approval) - it wasn't too bad on the run, but when I woke up the next morning it was very irritated. With that being said, we decided it was best for me to take off the entire week leading up to the race, minus some light cycling. I was super anxious and frustrated in these last few weeks before the marathon.

&#x200B;

\### Pre-race

Luckily, I know someone who lives in Staten Island so I was able to sleep at her house the night before the race, saving me from having to wait around at the start village for too long. I was up early anyway, did my exercises for my PTT; it was feeling good that morning. Ate my usual breakfast of a banana and toast  (2 pieces this time) about 2.5 hours before the race. I was sipping on water, but nothing crazy as I had really made a point to hydrate with water and electrolytes this whole week. I arrived at the start village around 8:00 am. Got through security quickly, and then had about an hour to kill before making my way over to the Pink Start Village when Wave 2 corrals opened up. About 30 minutes before the race, i took some ibuprofen as one last shot to help my foot last through this race. I took a Gu 20 minutes prior. I peed 3 or 4 times the race started, so eventually I told myself to stop the water so I wouldn't have to go during the race.

&#x200B;

\### Race

I had tears in my eyes as the cannon went off and 'New York, New York' started playing. I had been waiting for this moment for so long, and I couldn't believe it was finally here, after the months and months of training. I'm running the New York City f\*\*\*ing marathon! I was on the lower deck of the Verrazano Bridge which I didn't love. Not only were there minimal views, but the bigger problem was that the GPS on my watch did not work at all for the first 2 miles. People warned me about this, so before the race I turned off auto lap and decided to manually lap at each mile marker.

The plan was to start conservatively around a 9:30 pace on the first mile since its an uphill, make up a bit of time on the downhill of mile 2, and then settle in around a 9:05 ish pace for the next 6 or so miles. As far as nutrition, a Gu every 30-35 minutes and alternate water and gatorade endurance at every aid station. My foot hurt immediately from the get go, but it was bearable. Without the GPS, I truly had no idea how fast i was going! I tried to focus on effort. I clocked in the first mile at 9:28 - perfect. I controlled myself on the downhill. Then I settled into my pace as we entered Brooklyn. I definitely felt as though I was holding back, which I knew was a good thing. Brooklyn was very crowded with a lot of stopping and starting and bumping into people, especially after Williamsburg where there were no barriers for the spectators, making the road very narrow. I was feeling great up until about the halfway point when I started to notice a bit of fatigue creeping in, and my thought in the back of my mind was ""I still have the Queensboro bridge to conquer"". I had been so worried about this stupid bridge all through training. I also realized I was starting to feel thirsty and that concerned me. I started taking 2 cups at some of the fluid stations. I didn't understand why - I felt like I had adequately hydrated before the race.

Finally, it arrived - the dreaded Queensboro Bridge. I somehow had NO problem with it at all. I barely even felt it. I think the hills I ran during my training turned out to be a lot longer and steeper. I actually enjoyed the break from the crowds for a minute. I was so happy that I was feeling good at this point, as I was sure this would break me.  Eventually, I started to hear the crowds roaring from First Avenue as we descended the bridge. I stayed controlled with my pace, looking forward to seeing my friends and family around mile 17. I was feeling great when I saw them!

All of a sudden at some point between mile 18 and 19, I looked at what was in front of me and realized First Avenue is pretty much a full uphill - gradual, but a long hill. As I approached mile 19, my calves started to cramp uncontrollably. I didn't realize what it was at first, as I had never experienced this before. My breathing felt controlled, my mind didn't feel tired - but my legs were giving out. I had to stop and stretch them out in order to keep going. Thus began my run/walk/stretch combo for the rest of the race. I was so disappointed as I didn't think I would have to stop and walk at all. But the cramping was too painful. I'd get a surge for a bit and then have to stop again. It was discouraging at first. But once I accepted that my A goal was now out of reach, I decided to just keep going and do the best I could, walking or not. Take in the crowds, and just enjoy the experience. So that's what I did. Ran as much as I could, and stopped and walked when I needed to.

The Bronx was a bit of a blur but I do remember the crowd support being amazing. At this point i was grabbing 3 or 4 cups from every aid station, and a random water bottle from a child. I saw the ""last damn bridge"" sign and as happy as i was, i knew there was still Fifth Avenue to conquer. I don't even remember feeling much of this hill since i was both running and walking at this point. I knew my family and friends were going to be around 95th street between mile 23 and 24, so once i knew that was coming, i forced myself to keep running. It helped.  A lot.

Finally I entered central park and I at least knew at this point I was going to make it. The crowds in here were electric. Around mile 25, I stopped at an aid station and all of a sudden my quad completely locked up. I couldn't move my leg. The volunteer at the station asked if I needed help getting to the medical tent and I guess I said yes. She helped me cross over and they sat me down, applied something to my leg (maybe biofreeze? im not sure) had me take some salt, and were able to get the cramp out. I lost 4 minutes there. Again, something that I had never experienced before but it was so incredibly painful.

I got back into the race and finished as strong as I possibly could. I barely even noticed the hills in the park because I was just going on adrenaline. Once i saw the 400m to go sign, I got in the final push I needed to cross the finish line.

\### Post-race

As proud of myself as I was for finishing, I would be lying if I said i wasn't a little disappointed. But at the same time, this was my first marathon and I had no idea how my body was going to react. I was glad that I now know what to expect for next time, what I need to address, and what I need to do differently. I was just so happy I finished as all of my anxiety leading up to the race was surrounding whether my PTT would allow me to finish - who knew that instead, it would be cramps that would lead to my downfall. The PTT was present throughout the entire race, but I was actually distracted from it in the second half due to how bad the leg cramping was. I also stressed so much about the Queensboro - and it turns out, 1st Ave was my downfall.

Overall, it was an amazing experience and a race I would definitely run again - in 2025 - I want to try out a flatter course first next year. I also am planning on taking off from running for as much time as I need to get my PTT under control so that I can get back into it as healthy as possible. But i'm glad i did it!"

**Background**
  

  
M21 been running for two years with training taken more seriously of Sept 2023 onwards.
  

  
PRs
  
5k: 18:44 (Dec 2023)
  
10k: 38:57 (Dec 2023)
  
HM: 1:29 (Nov 2023)
  
M: 3:27 (April 2023)
  

  
My first marathon was Manchester 2023 and completed it with my goal of going sub 3:30. Back then I was running five days a week and training consisted of a VO2 max and a long run peaking at 37km with total milage peaking at 90km and an average of \~70km.
  

  
Since August 2023 I have been taking my training more seriously and upped the milage and started running almost six days a week and have remained 99% niggle free with me only missing a few days training due to niggles and staying on the cautious side.
  

  
**Training** 
  

  
Late September/early October I began the Pfitz 15/70 plan. I chose this plan as I thought the 15/55 was ‘too conservative’ and I wanted to increase the milage from my previous marathon. However, I did consider the 15/70 to be too intensive for myself so decided to use a blend of both plans to suit myself. In hindsight maybe this was a mistake.
  

  
I decided to replace his VO2 max workout with my coached VO2 max session with my running club. These consisted from a range of the ‘classic’ workouts (12x400; 10x600; 6x1k; ect). 
  

  
The first six weeks of the plan I followed strictly and aced the majority of the workouts. I peaked at 100km a week with my long run at 32km. I completed five  \~30k runs with some blocks at marathon pace or all easy, I also found the mid-week moderate long run to be beneficial however this was only 20k max. The long runs were starting to become tedious and very unenjoyable and combined with the crap UK weather it was a big slog.
  

  
I remained very much injury free and averaged around 85km a week over 12-15 weeks with 2x50km lower milage weeks due to a skiing holiday and Christmas and my running just suffered.
  

  
Overall, I thought the training went well and I was prepared enough for the marathon, although in the back of my mind I always thought I should of have a couple 35km runs but thought the higher cumulative milage combated this.
  

  
**Pre-race**
  

  
I flew out to Seville early Friday morning (three days prior to race). I found I had a hard time of just wanting to sit around vs visit the city as my partner also accompanied me for the race. I tried to manage my steps which were around 12,000 on the Friday and Saturday before the race which were probably to many. I did however eat in and ate healthy.
  

  
The morning of the race I walked to start which about a 30-minute walk and had two bagels which I struggled to get down due to nerves. I also felt a bit bloated from all the water I had been drinking. I knew it was going to be warm so took on more than usual plus I needed it to get the bagels down.
  

  
**Race**
  

  
I was in the 3:15-3:30 start box, but it felt these runners were much faster as the gun went off.
  

  
My aim was set out at 4:45 min/km pace and dial in the first 4-5 miles before upping the pace to 4:40. However, as you can see from the splits this was not the case and I rather much got sucked in.
  

  
One thing I did immediately notice was the warm sun beating down. Although it was only 13°C at the start climbing to 19°C a couple hours later -I could feel the heat and was a considerable difference from training in the UK from 0-10°C.
  

  
Although I knew this pace was quicker than my target, I felt good – breathing and legs were good, and I was enjoying ticking off the miles. When I did try to slow down I just couldn’t – there were lots of runners overtaking me and I was unable to settle into a slower pace. I took my first maurten gel around 50 mins into the race.
  

  
Come 10 miles I was still feeling strong, and I ticked by halfway in 1:38 (9 mins off my HM PR. However, I knew I didn’t have that super fresh feeling like I had in Manchester. Come 15 miles I felt how I should be 21 miles. I still had breathing under control, but my legs just felt beat – mainly in my quads.
  

  
I tried to slow down to 5:00 min/km at 24km but by then the damage was already done and I was feeling rough. Come 28k I had mentally given up and started to walk when I arrived at the water stations. I knew I had to continue trotting on till I found my partner as I was not running with my phone.
  

  
I found her at 30k, and I had an important decision to make – continue to finish with no goal in mind or call it a day. As I was only concerned about time, I called it a day.
  

  
I was severely gutted, and this was my first race DNF in my short running career.
  
**Post-race**
  

  
Still full of anger, annoyance,  disappointment and regret I didn’t go off slower. I told myself before not to go off fast and knew you couldn’t ‘bank miles’ and I took that stupid risk.
  

  
I believe I stated too fast and combined with the heat contributed to my downfall.
  

  
**Next Steps?**
  

  
All I have on my mind currently is a rebound marathon. Unsure on what timescales I should aim for? Should it be three weeks as I have the fitness? 6 weeks for a bit more training or even 10?
  

  
I did have plans to concentrate on 5 and 10k speed after this marathon with a 5k currently in the books on 17th March and a 10k on April 14th.
  

  
But all I want to do is another marathon – I know I have the fitness and I can do this and just want to prove it to myself.
  

  
I am currently considering the Great Welsh Marathon (4 weeks away): Barcelona (3 weeks) or Boston UK (10 weeks).
  

  
I don’t usually pay too much attention to race reports but as this went so wrong I wanted to share. Thank you for reading and this is my first race report so hope I have included enough detail, and it has the flow.
  

  
I know there is a ton of expertise on this page so any help on next steps, training, words of wisdom is much appreciated.

# Training

After setting my previous PR at Wineglass last year (great race, highly recommend) and having my least-worst Boston where I ran a 3:20:xx and came in 6000 places ahead of my bib, I was in a bit of a pickle to decide what my time goal should be. I had trained for Boston with a goal of 3:15 (which obviously I didn't hit), but I decided that given the weather and my ... history with the Boston course, I probably was in 3:15 shape and could aim for lower in another cycle. I know these sound like very incremental improvements, but that's the way I roll. 

Had a great cycle of Pfitz 70/18. I am honestly not sure what round of Pfitz this is for me but I am an aficionada of the midweek long run and the rest of it works for me. I am getting a little curious about 2Q or whatever, but then I look at the overwhelming math or whatever involved in planning those workouts and balk. Hit all my paces in training including that glorious 18/14MP long run where I average 7:17 for the 14@MP. Only thing I didn't do was any tune-up races because those are hard to find in a hot New England summer; I ran a 5K time trial to compensate where I broke 20:00 for the first time (I am really bad at shorter distances, primarily for barfing reasons, which will become salient later).

This is the most certain I have ever felt about my current fitness before a marathon, which is of course always a stochastic and brutal event that can utterly crush you. ;)

# Pre-race

Flew into Chicago with my husband and 2 year old to meet my parents, who flew from California to provide childcare while we ran. Went to the expo on Saturday which was well-organized but a bit overwhelming. Tried our best to lay low but toddler energy = hahaha good try. At least carrying her around everywhere counts as my only strength training the rest of the time. 

Taking prior advice from here to heart, I did my best to properly carb load (I think I did an okay-ish job) and planned to fuel with Maurten's gels following the Featherstone nutrition calculator.

After running every other race in the same workaday pegs I run in all the time, this was my first race in supershoes. Thanks to whoever found the crazy deal on neon pink Saucony Endorphin Pro 3s! I spotted a number of my bargain-hunting brethren on the course too ...

Wake up Sunday morning at 5:45, get dressed and head to Grant Park with my husband, who is recovering from a pretty horrific foot injury requiring surgery but decided to use his time qualification for a fun run. I was really dismayed by the portapotty lines, which, as the time cut down for getting into corrals became increasingly brutal. Multiple people aggressively cut me in line or ran out of line into an available portapotty in front of other waiting people. With only minutes to spare getting into the corral was pretty stressful, and then we stood around for a full 15 minutes after the start which I wasn't expecting since I was in wave 1 corral c. Overall this made me feel less negatively inclined towards the Hopkinton Athlete's Village, which I usually dunk on.

# Race

Is there anything as cool as hearing thousands of feet hitting the pavement at once? I really enjoyed running through the tunnel at the start and the crowd support is pretty amazing. As everyone had warned me, my GPS got quite wonky any time we were in downtown Chicago but I didn't even notice the 1M sign and just ran on feel for a bit and seemed to do okay. With GPS issues my watch estimated I ran about .4 miles long which I think is an overestimate but not too hard to manually lap as needed. All of the turns/curves sort of threw me off as that was not something I had a ton of practice on and of course the crowds around the blue line can't be practiced, but did my best to enjoy the experience. Around mile 7/8 I noticed a side cramp but didn't let myself panic and just told myself it would go away eventually.

Much gratitude to the drag queens and middle school taiko drummers around miles 11/12 which gave me a burst of energy as we crossed the bridge again. Finished the first half right on track and feeling pretty proud of my pacing since I can be a menace when running by feel. 

Miles 14-18 weren't the best though I couldn't pinpoint anything particularly tough, moreso being in my own head about how I was feeling. But my pace stayed bang on. Mile 19 is the start of Pilsen which really brought the energy and my spirits up; it was definitely my favorite mile of the course and put a big smile on my face. Loved the dragon dancers at mile 21 too!

My strategy is always to go for even splits and then see what I have left at mile 21, which is usually nothing or a negative amount. My last few PRs I have always been so surprised to still feel dreadful by the last 5 miles, just maintaining the same pace. The turns/lollipop structure of mile 23/24 really bummed me out but then I knew there was just one straightaway until the finish and I was doing it! I managed to choke down half a gel at mile 24 because I REFUSE to bonk, then keep plugging away at my pace and counting down seconds until I can stop. Curse at the stupid Abbot 400m sign and do my best to kick that last mile. Up Mt. Roosevelt and taking the final turn with <200m to go I start to heave, running down the straightaway with a trail of undigested gatorade and Maurten's.

I'd like to say my last-minute on-course vomiting cost me those 10 seconds over my A goal, but my half split was 1:36:04 so I pretty much ran the completely same pace the entire thing. And with a 3.5 minute PR (and honestly a time I never thought I would see for myself even a year ago), I'll take it!

# Post-race

Limp through the chute and call my parents who are tracking my husband, who is a bit behind me. He ended up having a blast with the 3:3x folks with no foot pain, perhaps even better than my PR. It takes forever to get to the runner reunion zone (like, FOREVER, some sort of sick joke on post-marathon legs) and then I get to give my toddler the biggest hug even though she is afraid of the space blanket I'm wearing. I got a free pair of Nike slides and balked at the line for free medal engraving. Celebrate with my family for the rest of the day!

I've set my sights on a sub-3:10 in the hopes of of qualifying for Berlin and because it truly seems like a time I would never, ever think myself capable of. I'm (sigh) running Boston again this spring but considering picking a different A race because I just can't PR there. I also really need to run a half at some point.

Love the expertise and wisdom (and commiseration) of this community, if anyone has recs to make this 36 year old lady faster (or maybe just barf less), I am so happy to hear them. :)

### Training
When I first put Boston on my schedule, the plan was not to race it, but after a strong half marathon at[Richmond](https://old.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1gumm5i/race_report_richmond_half_marathon_or_how_i/?ref=share&ref_source=link), I decided to be ambitious and shoot for a PR. According to the VDOT calculator, my half time suggested a 2:38 marathon, so I set my sights on breaking 2:40.  

I followed Pfitz 18/70 since his plans and this mileage have worked for me in the past. This was my first time doing an 18-week plan, but I had a lot of free time at the start and just wanted to jump into training. Overall, this block was a mixed bag. The first 13 weeks went really smoothly, with me hitting the mileage every week except for being sick during a down week. About two months into the block, I started a job, which meant shifting from being a morning runner with endless recovery time to an evening runner rushing home to squeeze in a 15-miler before dinner.  

To prepare for Boston’s hills, I did hill sprints every other week and made sure to get at least one run a week with more elevation gain than Boston. Living in the NC Piedmont, it's probably harder not to get that elevation, to be honest. Every week I did a core routine and strength training focusing on glutes, calves, quads, balance, and plyometrics.  

During the LT workouts, I struggled to hit goal paces, but I felt comfortable on the MP long runs, especially on the 18-miler with 14 at MP where I averaged 6:00 and felt like I could go forever. Right after that run, I noticed some irritation in my right shin, likely anterior tibial tendonitis, so I cut down on mileage and intensity for two weeks, getting back to the plan right before the taper.  

I had planned to do three tune-up races but only ended up doing one real one: a hilly 5K where I ran 15:58, though the course was short and only 3 miles. I was signed up for a 10K I had to skip due to injury, and two weeks out, I did a 5-mile time trial in 27:18. While I didn’t have many race results to test myself and had some injury anxieties, I felt confident about my fitness heading into the taper.  

### Pre-race
The taper itself sucked. My taper crazies showed up as posterior shin splints on my left leg and a weird sore spot on my right heel. Neither injury got worse and both ended up being completely unnoticeable during the race, but they were enough to make me lose my mind and spend way too much time stressing and stretching.  

I flew up to Boston on Friday with my family and had an active two days, going to the expo that afternoon, visiting Fenway, doing to the Tracksmith shakeout, and shopping at some pop ups, before leaving the city Saturday afternoon to stay with relatives. On Sunday I was completely stagnant apart from 25 minute shakeout with some strides. It was a bit tricky to carb-load while traveling and on a tight schedule, but I managed to get a pasta dish in the North End and loaded up on sugary drinks, granola bars, and fruit snacks.  

On race morning, I got a solid 5 hours of sleep, ate half a bagel and some oatmeal, and got dropped off at the buses near Hopkinton right at 7:30. It was convenient to have such a short bus ride, but ended up being tough for my family trying to spectate along the course. If I did it again, I’d probably just leave from Boston Common with everyone else. The athlete's village was surprisingly chill, and I had plenty of time to lounge around and snack before changing into my race shoes.  

I considered buying a new pair of race shoes but waited too long and ended up going with my battle-tested Saucony Endorphin Pro 4s. Hats off to the BAA—the organization was fantastic and everything was super clear. After a short walk/jog and one last bathroom stop, I found myself a row or two back from the start of corral 4.  

While my original goal was to break 2:40, I knew it would be a challenge, especially with an uncomfortable taper and on a warmer sunny day. Aside from time goals, I wanted to crack the top 1000 and, more importantly, just have a good time. I wrote “We do this because it’s fun” on my hand next to my watch to remind myself that I picked this hobby because I enjoy it and that times aren’t everything.  

### Race
Most of the race is a blur, so this won’t be a mile-by-mile breakdown, just the general vibes.  
The gun went off at 10 AM, but I didn’t cross the start line until two minutes later. Everyone says not to go out too fast in Hopkinton, but in the chaos of the start I ended up going out slow. My race plan was to stay above 6-minute miles until Heartbreak Hill, then send it afterwards. But after mile 1 clocked in at 6:13, I realized I wasn’t with the right crowd and accelerated, hoping to find a group to settle in with. I eventually found people running a similar pace, but never truly was able to turn my brain off and lock in. Around mile 9 I realized my pacing strategy wasn’t working well for the course, so I mentally let go of the watch and just focused on running what felt fast but sustainable.  

For fueling, I drank a caffeinated Nuun in the corral, carried a bottle of Tailwind for the first 10 miles, and took uncaffeinated Maurtens at miles 2 and 12, and 40mg caffeine GUs at miles 7 and 17. I feel I get the best energy return from Maurten, but still use a lot of GU since it’s cheaper and I can’t handle the 100mg caffeine Maurtens.  

Throughout the race I just felt uncomfortable. A side stitch popped up multiple times, I had to skip a gel at mile 22 due to stomach issues, and my right side tightened up earlier than usual. My right leg has always been a bit of a menace, probably because that foot is slightly larger than the left, but this time it might’ve been worse because I found a few rocks in my shoe while packing up the next morning. No way to know for sure, though. Also, even though people kept saying the weather was perfect, it felt warm and the sun was draining, as you can tell by the sunburn down the right side of my body.  

I thought I was well prepared for the hills, but they lived up to their reputation. Heartbreak ended up being my slowest mile of the day. I also assumed that after Newton it would be all downhill, but those small rollers just took it out of me. I never totally hit the wall, but the combo of heat, hills, and stomach issues took its toll and I slowed down instead of getting that negative split.  

Now onto the positives—oh my god, the crowds were amazing. It was unreal passing through town centers lined with hundreds of people all cheering for you. Wellesley was probably the most surreal and energizing moment of my life. I even saw family at miles 6, 13, and 17. I know this paragraph is short, but this was the most important part of the race by far. Without the crowds, I think I would’ve run 10 minutes slower and probably have been too grouchy to write a race report.  

The last few miles running into Boston were brutal, especially that dip under the bridge at mile 25.5, but I cannot say enough about the crowd support carrying me through it. I knew the drill: right on Hereford, left on Boylston, and gave it everything I had in that final sprint, crossing the finish line in 2:42:04.    

### Post-race
First thought: that shit hurt. I hobbled through the finish area, grabbed a medal, tons of snacks, chugged two bottles of water and a Gatorade, then found my family right outside the exit. I sat down to change out of my race shoes and instantly cramped up, but I can’t overstate how incredible the volunteers were, as a medic quickly stopped by and helped massage the cramps out. I knew I had to keep moving, so I made my way over to the T and went to get a celebratory beer.  

I didn’t hit my A goal, but it was an ambitious one, and an 8-minute PR is still amazing. Slightly annoying that I finished 1009th, just missing my top 1000 goal, but I keep thinking about how I had a rough day on a tough course and still ran a great time and walked away happy. I think letting go of pace at mile 9 saved my race and helped me remember this is supposed to be fun.  

Physically, I’m hurting. My quads actually feel decent, but both calves are rocks and stairs have been a process. Apart from my legs, I’ve recovered alright. In my last two marathons, I had no appetite or couldn’t keep down fluids after the race, but that wasn’t an issue this time, which hopefully is a good sign for the recovery process.  

As for what’s next, I’m not exactly sure. I’m doing a beer mile relay with some friends this weekend, which will be an interesting first run back. Beyond that, I’m planning to do a few shorter races this summer to work on speed before jumping into another fall marathon block. I don’t know what the next race will be, but I do know I want a smaller race on an easier course. I’d love to come back to Boston someday, but probably not to race it—this is one to do just for fun :)

# Background

I am 35, started running in 2023 mainly as a way to be fit. Racing was never something I considered attempting. For 2023 I slowly built up to 15mi/week using a Z2 strategy and sustained that for most of that year. At the beginning of 2024, a friend of mine (a runner) convinced me to sign up for a half marathon. So I trained at \~20mi/wk using a garmin coach (McMillan) with the hope of a sub-2hr and managed 1:56 and change in May 2024 in Buffalo, NY. At the start, I wasn't even sure I'd crack 2hr and by the end I felt as if I left some time on the table.

At any rate, I was hooked.

I then scaled my training up to \~30mi/wk in prep for a fall half marathon in Rochester, NY with the goal of breaking 1:50. I tried to make my own plan modified from a Hanson's Half marathon plan. Despite a good training block, it was unfortunately hot and humid (dewpoint was 68F) with large (for me) hills at the back end. I respected none of these and ran as if conditions were perfect which caused me to hit a wall at mile 10 and I limped to 1:55 (technically a PB, but I wasn't happy about it). Retrospectively, I'm glad to have that experience of trying and failing but knowing I had more in me, I targeted the Flower City Challenge half in Rochester, NY for the spring.

**Pre-training prep**

Post Sept 2024 half, I worked on getting my body used to a 35-40mi/week. This time I bought all of the running books I could from Daniels to Pfitz to Hudson to Hanson. Running has clearly become a hyper-fixation of mine. I ended up using the Daniel's 4th edition Alien Plan because I liked the predictibility of the structure with the flexibility in what the workouts looked like/what the weekly mileage could be.

**Training block**

I started the training block in later January which instantly got derailed due to a very bad case of the Flu, knocking me out for 5 days. 4 weeks later I irritated a back injury from 5+ years ago which caused me to be cautious with mileage/workouts, but it ended up not getting in the way (and it still causes some discomfort even today, just none while running). 4 weeks later I got a stomach bug (if you haven't put it together yet, I have young school-aged children) which MERCIFULLY only put me out for one full day.

In terms of workouts, I picked them mostly from the 40mi/week tables in JD's book, sometimes pulling from the 41-55 (for threshold workouts, specifically). My long easy runs I tried to maintain 2hr each sunday, regardless of where the mileage actually fell (but usually around 12.5mi). For marathon pace runs I just added one mile of M-Pace work each workout, starting at 3 and ending at 6. My longest run

**Strategy**

In terms of training strategy, I stuck to being a Daniel's disciple (for the most part). I used the VDOT methodology to set training paces and was diligent about adding in strides as prescribed (something I felt is one of the best things I've added to a training regimen. Just being able to work on good mechanics without the fatigue is amazing). In addition, given my poor performance in the Fall of 2024, I incorporated FAR more hills in my training, especially on long runs. Western New York is fairly flat, but I was getting 600-900ft in elevation per week. The half I failed on was a total of 800ft, for reference.

ONE modification I made, more for my psychological benefit, was in week T-4 and onwards, I replaced the I/R workouts with half-marathon-specific work. This was more for me on the mental side of things because this is only my fourth race ever (I ran a 4mi race in between my first two half marathons). These modifications were as follows

* **T-4:** 4x1mi at HMP with 90s rest
* **T-3:** 3x2mi at HMP with 3min jg
* **T-2:** 2x3mi at HMP with 5min jg
* **T-1:** 4mi at HMP

This gave me 20 miles of HMP work and my average pace through all of these was 7:53min/mi or 1:43:21 expected HM finish. Phenomenal prediciton.

**Fueling**

In the previous two half marathons I used sour patch kids for fuel. I had tried Honey Stinger gels for the Sept 2024 half, but good lord they were tough to put down. This time around I wanted to give gels a real shot and purchased some SiS isotonic and Maurten gels. SiS was ok, but the flavoring was a bit odd. Maurten were it. Kind of a marshmallow taste (which I don't particularly like) but the mild sweetness and consistency seemed to sit well with me. Very happy my body likes the most expensive gels out there...

Anyways, I opted for the Maurten and trained with them, mainly on the M-pace long runs. One at the 40-45min mark and another at the 80-90min mark. In the mornings I'd eat a single raspberry pop tart at least an hour before my run. This combo worked really well for me.

# Pre-Race

The days leading up to the race I didn't do anything particularly special. Tried to bank sleep, stay hydrated, and eat a balanced diet. The night prior I had pasta (surprise, surprise), but nothing I hadn't previously tested during training.

Looking to race day, it was shaping up to be a windy day. The kind where it's a crapshoot on what to wear. 40F in the morning (shorts and t-shirt weather for a race) but with 20mph winds and 40mph gusts, with a wind chill in the low 30s, high 20s. I opted for shorts and a long-sleeve tee and added a thin beanie and gloves. I normally run with a hat, but figured the wind would rip it from me, so left it back.

My wife graciously helped get the kids up and we drove downtown for the race. Race began at 7:30, we parked around 7:00 and I jogged around for a bit to warm up before lining up.

# Race

**Miles 1-3:**

I line up behind the 1:50 pacer because it's way easier on me mentally to pass people than to be passed. Gun goes off and we start. Everyone (myself included) starts way too fast, as is tradition, before settling into a groove. First bit is downhill but right into the wind and multiple hats are lost. Called it. We loop around and I take my gloves off right at mile 3 as wee loop past the starting line.

**Miles 4-6:**

Wind is totally gone now and the sun is up, so I end up taking the hat off and rolling up my sleeves. Coming down a flat stretch I take my first gel. I know there's a hill right after mile 6, so I pull back on my pace a bit to make sure I conserve energy. I was a bit concerned here because my heartrate looked high, but my breathing felt totally normal so I didn't try to overcorrect. I just kept an eye on it (this would hold true for the rest of the race, my heartrate was higher than I expected, but I never crossed LT).

**Miles 6-8:**

We hit the hill and it was way less of an issue than I anticipated. Probably a mix of training and a healthy level of respect, but it caused zero issues for me. However, there was a LARGE group of people bombing up and then down the hill that audibly suffered toward the end of the race, so I was happy with my strategy here. Rather finish a minute slower over my optimal time as opposed to hitting the wall and missing my goals. Once I got past the two hills (there was a second one according to the elevation profile, I just don't remember it, really) I took my last gel.

**Miles 9-10:**

At this point I'm checking in with mysself to see how my heartrate is doing, how my legs are feeling and whether to push or pull back. I felt good, no pain in the legs (beyond what's expected), but heartrate was a tad higher than I thought. However, my breathing still felt fine so I told my watch it was wrong and decided to push.

**Miles 11-13:**

The goal here was simple: pick a person in front of you and pull past them. Do this over and over and until the final stretch. Such a strong mental motivator to pass people one after the other. You kind of feel like a real Colin Robinson, just sapping their energy to fuel you.

**Final Stretch:**

Just put my foot down until I crossed the finish. This final bit Strava has as a 7:08 pace which feels about right for the effort. Always feels good to finish strong, even if it's only a difference of a few seconds. Coming up to the finish and seeing that 1:43:xx on the board was such a good feeling.

# Post-race

I hit all my goals, so am obviously very happy. All the training paid off and I was vindicated for my poor performance in my last race. I learned a ton about myself in this training block in terms of what works, what doesn't, and what to focus on. Hills are something I definitely want to add more of and strength training FOR SURE needs to be a part of this, especially since I'm not getting any younger. But I feel like I still have a ways to go to reach my ceiling; just have to hope father time doesn't cause that ceiling to come crashing down too quickly. Mid-term goal (next 1-2 years) would be a sub-1:40 and long-term (which may never happen) is a sub-1:30.

Another part of the post-mortem is that my result here was going to dictate whether I attempt a marathon in the fall and I believe I will (with a target in the 3:30-3:40 range, TBD). Everyone always says your goal for your first marathon should be just to finish, and I get that, but what's the point of a goal if you're not going to challenge yourself?

**Training/Background**

24F

I ran track and cross country for 2 years in high school and was able to walk onto my uni's D1 track/cross country team. I quit after a year then stopped running until 2022 when I ran my first marathon without any long runs. I don't recommend it-I still have knee/IT band pain from that. I have done 7 more since then, making Tokyo my 8th marathon.

I started training for Tokyo 2 weeks after the NYC Marathon which I had decided to not race. I developed some discomfort in my right foot early on in the cycle, mainly my post tib & achilles. I have been working with a physical therapist for the past two years who has made my training plans. She had me running 40 mpw average with one speed workout on the track and then a tempo long run. Had I not struggled with on and off foot pain, I think I would've run higher mileage and should going forward.

This is the first training cycle where I had regular tempo long runs, which I think were very helpful. My PT/Coach had me doing long runs with the last 10 miles faster. I did an 18 miler with the last 10 at 7:45 pace, a 20 with the middle 1- at 7:50, a 20 with the last 10 at 7:45, and a 22 miler with the last 10 at 7:40.

My fastest marathon to date was from Reykjavik 2024 in August--3:27. We were hoping to get me under 3:25 this time which is why I aimed for 7:40 and 7:45 in faster parts of the long runs.

**Pre Race**

I usually have pancakes, fried eggs, and fruit for breakfast before a race, and since my hotel didn't serve breakfast until after I needed to leave, I had bought some pastries, bananas, and rice. I wasn't sure if it would be enough food, but I ended up ok. I didn't adjust well to the time zone change (14 hours) despite arriving Wednesday before the race, so I felt groggy leading up to the start. I was excited regardless and trusted my training.

**Race**

The start was crowded, and I definitely wasted some energy/added some distance weaving around people. My strategy was going to be to run the first 10 miles between 7:45-7:50 per mile and then 7:40-75 for the second 10 miles, then just close out as strong as I could. They didn't have any more 3:25 pace bracelets when I went to the expo, so I programmed the plan into my watch. When I was flipping through the stats on my watch to check heart rate, time of day, etc, I accidentally pressed the lap button and changed to the next step of the workout. I pressed the lap button again and decided to try to just run and not keep checking my watch.

I crossed the half mark at 1:42 and knew I needed to push a bit. My left knee that I have had problems with in the past felt uncomfortable but not painful starting around mile 15. I briefly stretched at the water stations but mainly ignored it, and I stopped noticing it around mile 22.

I was trying my best to not look at my watch except to see my pace each time I completed another mile. I felt pretty good at mile 20 and realized that I was going to be under 3:25 as long as I didn't slow down. At this point, it was warm, and I regretted not stopping at some of the earlier water stations.

Aside from some knee pain and accidentally hitting the lap button, the race went pretty well. My nutrition was on point, and my hydration was good enough--my splits were a little back and forth but still in the desired range or faster. I think I got another burst of energy when I saw my parents at the 37 kilometer area and then realized I could be under 3:20 if I maintain pace. I ran a 3:19:18 with a negative split--an 8 minute PR from Reykjavik in August. I could not have asked for better. I am hoping it is enough to time qualify into my last two world major stars (Boston & Chicago).

**Post-race**

I was slightly frustrated with myself for my watch error and my slight knee pain, but I was otherwise very pleased with my result. I felt amazing when I knew I was going under both 3:25 and 3:20. My knee hurt quite a bit leaving the race area, and it took me a while to feel rehydrated, but I can't complain. In the future, I will up my weekly mileage & make my own pace bracelet to follow. "

**Training**

Like many, I started running during the pandemic because gyms were closed. In March of 2020, I quit smoking cigarettes after doing so for most of the previous 25 years as my wife turned 40 and I would be later that year. In May, after being bored of at-home workouts after two months, I decided I'd try running, never having done so in my life. I previously told myself I couldn't run because my knees were often sore. Downloaded the Couch to 10K app, where the first workout is litterally run for 30 seconds and walk for a minute. 6 weeks later, having finished the plan and being able to run for an hour straight, I decided I wanted to run a marathon (or 42.2K) before I turned 40, which was 14 weeks away. Suffice to say, all marathons were cancelled in the fall of 2020, so I made a plan to run a virtual version of the 2020 London Marathon a week after the actual event on the same course, right before my 40th. Downloaded the NRC app, completed the 14 week plan, went off ran the virtual event in 4:12. After feeling destroyed for a few days, decided I wanted to keep going and gave myself until 2025 to qualify for Boston. 

Kept running regularly over the next 21 months, but nothing super structured. In July of 2022, I lost both of my parents to lifestyle-diseases four days apart, so my best friend who lives in Toronto (I live in London) and I decided to run NY 2022. We found a tour company with two spots available 16 weeks out, paid our money, and started training. I used NRC again, stuck to the plan, but didn't really change my diet other than cutting out alcohol 2 weeks before the race (I was arguably a clinical alcoholic beforehand and definitely leaned on it as a coping mechanism after my parents' deaths). 

As we all know, NYC 2022 was incredibly warm. I went out too fast, bonked, and finished at **4:14** after a 1:50 first half. 

Next race was Paris 2023 in April. I switched training plans to the RW sub-3:45 plan. Completed every training run. Cut alcohol out completely for weeks 5 - 8 and 13 - 16. Smashed my target by coming in at **3:28**. With the BQ cutoff 19 mins away and having knocked 46 mins off my NYC time, I thought a BQ was potentially a year away. 

Got into Chicago 2023. Decided to use RW sub-3:15 plan. Honestly found it quite easy. Cut alcohol out completely, outside of 2 weeks of holiday in August, felt like 3:10 was in the bag and 3:05 was possible. Boy was I wrong. I went out too hard chasing a 3:05 instead of sticking to the original 3:10 plan, bonked hard at KM 30, which shifted the goal from 3:05 to 3:10. Pulled a hamstring at 35KM, which slowed me down further, came in at **3:18**. I was devasted, mad at myself, but determined to do better, which brings us to prep for London. 

Given the acclaim the plan had on this board, purchased PFitz's Advanced Marathoning, and after feedback here that 18/70 was likely too big of a jump, settled on doing 18/55. I had 10 weeks between Chicago and the start of the plan. Built my way back to 45 mpw over 9 weeks before starting the plan (took one week off completely) and kicked it off December 18 with the goal of running sub-3:00. 

Plan was tough, but found it entirely manageable. I followed it to a T, with the exception of flipping weeks 12 and 13 so I could run Barcelona in place of an MP long Run on March 10th. Diet was key. Ditched the alcohol completely again and upped my carb intake substantially to help with my recovery (I was also lifting 4/5 times per week). 

Ran an HM in Feb in place of an MP long run in 1:29, with 70% of the race in Zone 3. Felt super fresh. For Barcelona, the plan was to run 2 miles at recovery pace, then 14 miles at MP, followed by 10 miles at recovery pace. Stuck to this, although the recovery pace was more of a Zone 3 pace. Finished in **3:04:14**, but more importantly, felt super fresh after. This gave me huge confidence for London. Was also a great test for gels every 20 mins to avoid bonking, which I did. Decided I'd stickt to this for London. 

Taper was solid, with only hiccup being I had to do the first week on a hotel treadmill as we had a family commitment in KL. Hate treadmills. AC in the gym was non-existent, so ended up going at much slower paces, but the heat exposure was probably good training in hindsight. 

**Pre-Race**

Kept a keen eye on the weather after the stories of Boston heat-driven blowups permeated this thread. Was a bit concerned when initial forecasts were for \~16C. Was very pleased as they came down to 11/12C over the couse of the week, with wind being the one caveat. However, sometimes we have to be careful what we wish for. 

Went to the expo Wednesday to pick up my kit and chat with the head Pacer. Met him earlier in the trianing block through a mutual friend. He was the one who suggested running Barcelona, so wanted to chat strategy with him. He let me know the pacers would be aiming for even splits and spoke highly of the two gents who were pacing sub-3:00 in Blue Wave 2. I decided at that point that my strategy would be to stick to the pacer as long as possible and hopefully breakaway in the final KM to get a bit of a buffer under 3:00. 

Best friend from TO that I mentioned earlier got into town on the Thursday, so we went back to the expo to get his kit and hang out. Started the carb load that day (target of 8G / KG, so \~520G / day), much to my wife's amusement. Since I'm not a big pasta guy, my carb load involved lots of rice and sweet potatoes, with a usual amount of protein, but drastically reduced fat to stay within my calorie targets (generally \~3,200 - 3,500 cal / day, depending on training load). 

Stayed off our feet as much as possible Friday and Saturday. Checked out Monkey Man and Dune 2 at the cinema, and generally laid low. 

Race morning, was up at 5:00 to have my usual pre-race meal, which consists of a a protein shake with bananas, berries, apples, greek yogurt, and almond milk and a coffee as soon as I get up, followed by 100 grams of sourdough toast with peanut butter about an hour later. This gives me \~800 calories, lots of energy and feeling good. Moderated my water intake in the morning as I have a weak bladder and tend to have to stop once or twice per race. Didn't want to do that and it almost came back to haunt me. 

Left the house at 7:25 to head to Charing Cross where we changed trains for Blackheath. Got there with plenty of time to spare. Wished my friend luck as we were in separate color corrals and began the process of stretching and multiple bathroom breaks while trying to stay warm as the wind was COLD AF (be careful was you ask for). Went into the corral right at 9:52. Found the sub-3:00 pacers just to my left and decided to stick with them the entire way as planned. 

As they moved us from the corral to the start point, took advantage of the chance to empty my bladder completely along the fence, but that meant that I'd lost site of the pacers. Made my way to the starting line and was off!

**Race**

As soon as I hit the course, I looked around for the sub-3:00 pacers. Saw that one was 50M in front of me. Quickly decided I would give myself time to catch up to him, instead of sprinting to do so, just needed to keep him in site. 

500M into the race, I had my first equipment malfunction! My HR monitor slipped off my chest and ended up around my waist. I spent 5 seconds trying to pull it up, before giving up and deciding I'd rely on my watch HR measurement. 

First few KMs were pretty fast, but easy. I was mindful to not go too hard given the tendency for people to go out hard on the downhill 2KM from the start. Got water at the first stop 3KM, felt great, but nearly experienced my second equipment malfunction. I was a bit too enthusiastic throwing my bottle off the course, which some how caused my left airpod to fall out of my ear. Fortunately, luck and my reflexes enabled me to catch it behind my back and put it back in. However, it didn't play any music the rest of the way, so I was down to music in one ear!

Caught up to the pacer about 4KM in and made the plan to stick with him and the pack for the balance of the race. Hit the 5KM mark in 20:38, putting us about 37 seconds ahead of 3-hour pace. Pace felt good and easy, thought I had a chance to maintain. 

Pacer slowed a smidge from 5KM to 10KM, cover it in 21:16, which left us 36 seconds ahead of 3-hour pace. Started to make friends with the others in the pack. Was judicious with water to avoid needing to stop during the race, generally hitting every other stop and not taking the whole thing. This would come back to haunt me later. 

We covered 10KM to 15KM slightly behind 3:00 pace, in 21:46, which left us right on track for 3:00. Crowds were incredible! Everyone in the pack was running well, taking turns leading and following. The dream was definitely within reach. 

The 20KM mark on Tower Bridge is a highlight of the race! Crowd / energy is incredible. Only comparable thing I've seen in a race is the Brooklyn section of NYC, which is equally energetic, but lasts a bit longer. Pacer was critical to staying under control and not going too fast with the crowd energy. We hit the halfway point at 1:29:40, with 20 seconds in the bank and feeling great. 

Spent the next two KMs getting ready to look for my wife and friends at Shadwell, which is one of the best places to watch the race. Sadly, it was too busy, so I didn't manage to see them and they didn't manage to see me. However, I knew there'd be a chance to see them on the way back, so that gave me hope. 

We hit the 25K mark at 1:46:21, so were now 6 seconds behind pace, completely doable. However, this is where I started to get concerned about stomach cramps. Had I screwed up by not taking in enough water? My dreams of sub-3:00 were quickly fading, but I decided I'd either hit my goal or collapse trying. I wasn't going to ease up. I decided I'd take in full water at every stop to rehydrate and hope for the best. A Lucozade station 30 seconds later was a god-send. Took two cups down. Don't know if it actually helped or was all mental, but I quickly started to feel better and became confident I could hit the goal. 

Got to the 30KM mark at 2:07:44. We were 14 seconds behind 3:00 pace, but I felt good. Everyone's Garmins went a bit nuts about then as we were in Canary Wharf. Turned to the gent I'd been running with for a few KMs and told him ""we f\*\*\*\*ng got this"". He gave me a ""sure buddy, whatever"" look and kept running. 

Hit the 21 mile mark at about 2:23, which meant we had 37 minutes to cover 5 miles. Given that 3:00 pace is 6:52 per mile, this gave me full confidence I / we would come in sub-3:00. 

Managed to see my wife and friends at Shadwell on the way back, just after mile 21. Blew her a kiss and screamed I Love You. This was the equivalent of a Nos boost in Fast & Furious. 

Next three KMs went well as we passed Tower Bridge, went through the tunnel, and came out with the London Eye in sight. At this point, the pacer and the group picked up the pace and moved about 50M ahead of me. I started to worry I might not make it, but had 19 mins to go to cover 4.2KMs. Told myself I could anything for 20 mins and to buck up. Hit the 24 mile mark with \~16 mins to go. I knew I'd hit 3:00 if I could kick it at 4:20 / km pace, so started to relax. 

Caught back up to the Pace group around 40KM mark, which we hit at 2:49:52 point. 10 mins to hit 2.195 KM left me feeling great. Made the right passed Big Ben right before the 41KM mark just under 2:54. Goal was within reach, needed to hold it together for another 5 mins or so. Hit the 600M and 400M to go marks next to St James Park feeling great. Passed the pacer in the last 200M (to be fair, he had slowed down to encourage people from the pack to finish). Crossed the line in **2:59:08**, mission accomplished! BQ for 2025 highly likely. Felt on top of the world. 

**Post-race**

Gleefully got my medal, which is beautiful IMO, made my way to the lorry to collect my bag, then had a banana and a protein bar before throwing on my NYC 2022 blanket and making my way to the meet up point to find my wife and best friend. Found her, but he hadn't made it yet. She let me know he missed his 3:10 B goal and came in at 3:14:56. I thought he'd hit 3:07, but he been sick and the travel definitely took a toll on him. 

Finally found him, he was crushed and cursing himself for screwing up the race. We tried to encourage him to be kinder to himself and acknowledge that any PB and sub BQ cutoff time is worth celebrating (he'll be 45 on race day next year, meaning 3:20 is his cutoff). 

Took forever to get out of the meet up area as we had to wait for lanes to open up to cross the street. We walked towards Victoria, but found a cab, so jumped in and headed home. Quick shower, stretch and massive protein shake later, headed to the local pub to meet out friends (we were super later given how long it took to get out of the race). Had my first pint in months and the incredible privilege of being surrounded by friends and loved wins with a multi-year goal accomplished (I hope). 

Next race on tap is Berlin in September, with a potential dress rehearsal some time in August. 

Will have to decide if I want to move up to PFitz 18/70 to push towards sub-2:55 or look to maintain the 3:00ish time frame, but that decision is at least five weeks away following the PFitz post-race recovery plan.

Congrats to everyone who ran yesterday! Huge thank you to the sub-3:00 pacer who kept me from doing anything stupid. 

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read this, apologies for the length.

# Training

Originally, I (M20) was signed up for the full marathon for this race, which I did just after missing sub-3 (3:01) in the NYC marathon in November. Did my own extremely rushed 11-week training plan, where I went from <50 miles run in the past 8 months (Jan-July 2024) to a 73-mile peak week by mid-October. I figured that if I stayed consistent and raced a flat course, I'd be in sub-3 shape and maybe even faster, ideally getting a BQ. 

After NYC, I took about 2 months off due to a combination of a mental break, overall soreness, and just busyness at the end of my college semester. At the start of the new year, I decided to start training again. I was again just doing my own training plan, as I hate being tied into preset plans/ I like the flexibility of deciding what I want to do each day (I ran through all of hs and have been running on and off for around 6 years, so I generally know how to react to how my body feels/ create balanced workouts). First two build-up weeks, I ran 9 then 18 miles, then immediately got the flu and was totally out of commission for a week. Got back, had a 25-mile week, and then back-to-back 40-mile weeks, and then I got hurt. My right knee hurt a bit during a 4-mile easy run. I figured it was just general soreness and iced it, (stupidly) did a 13-mile long run the next day, and by the end of it, I could barely even walk. 

I've had tendonitis in the past, so I immediately booked a doctor's appointment and an MRI, and when I found out there was nothing wrong with my knee internally, I saw a PT. after about 2.5 weeks of no running, my PT told me to start again with easy, but consistent runs mixed in with strength trainning. It took me about 2 weeks of this until I felt like I was back and pain-free. At this point, I changed my registration from the full to the half and figured I'll just find a full later in the year to give myself some more time to train. 

I had about 6 weeks of good training, but only got up to 45 miles pre-race, as I was still taking 2 days off per week to make sure my knee was ok and to make sure I'm not building up too fast. I was also not really doing many workouts since I wanted to be super cautious with my knee, especially since I've had knee issues in the past, and I'm still pretty young. Since I saw this race as more of a training run for a future marathon, I wasn't really planning on tapering, but I caught a cold the week of the race and had to take 3 days off due to that, so I ended up somewhat tapering. My best workout in this short buildup was the week before the race, where I did a 5-mile tempo at 6:19 pace, where I closed in a 6:07. 

Pre-race

Woke up around 4:30, left my house (30 min away from start) at about 5:15. Traffic by the start to enter the parking lots was a nightmare. My friend and I (who I drove) ended up missing bag check and just got ready/ left our stuff in my car. Thankfully, I found my dad like 2 minutes before the race started and I was able to give him my AirPods case, phone, and car keys. 

# Race

I kinda decided day of I was gonna race this, as I had my doubts since I was a little sick and really hadn't done that many workouts. I never raced a half before so I figured I'd go out in about a 6:30, see how I felt, and pick it up/ slow down if needed. I got excited and ended up going out in a 6:20, but felt fine and basically said screw it lets just see how long I can hold this for, not really caring if I died out/ what I hit. 

Held around a 6:20 +/- a few seconds for the first 8 miles, and then subconsciously just started picking it up. As I saw each mile come in sub-6:20, I waited for the moment I was gonna die out, and was doing math in my head to figure out what I'd hit if I just started running 7 min miles, but this moment never came. I negative split the whole race and ended up running a lot faster than I expected to, and I felt pretty good at the end, too. A hill slowed down the start of my 12th mile, and I really thought I was gonna die out, but a nice cheer group and downhill around mile 12.5 really got me moving, so I ramped up my pace even more, and just held on for dear life and told myself I can't quit with just a mile and a half left.

Post-race

Now, I'm trying to figure out what marathon to run, and I have some knee pain again after running 3 times this week after this half. I'm hoping some PT and a few days off can solve my knee issues, but I still have to figure out what marathon I'm gonna do, and what pace I should go out at. I think a BQ with the cutoff is a bit of a longshot, as I'd likely need a sub-2:50, but I have some confidence I can run a 2:55 and at least get the Chicago qualifier. Considering racing either the Manitoba (Winnipeg) marathon, or the Missoula marathon in June for this 2:55 attempt, but haven't signed up for either yet.

# Background and Training

33M. I've talked about my background here before, which is basically grew up playing soccer, did some XC in high school, started running again in 2021 and then more seriously in summer of 2022 when I started working with a coach. Previous marathon race reports: [Chicago](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/y0z7lg/race_report_chicago_edition_giving_the_marathon/), [Glass City](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/12wqjlm/race_report_glass_city_toledo_marathon_23942/), [Boston](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1c5wjqi/race_report_2024_boston_marathon_23621_for_a_1/).

Training was weird for this block! After Boston this past spring, I started building back up again but got a  glute injury when I was only around 50 miles/week. I eventually had to shut down training before the end of May and didn't run for a couple of weeks before starting a run/walk program. First full week of running with no run/walk was June 24–30, for a total of 22 miles. I increased \~10 miles each week and slowly re-introduced speedwork, but by the time August rolled around, I had only hit a weekly maximum of 60 miles, which is pretty low for me. Needless to say, the Chicago build wasn't the build I dreamed of, but I did end up hitting 3 weeks at 97 miles and 1 week at 102, so I got some good mileage in after all.

4 weeks out from Chicago, I ran the Philly Distance Run (half marathon) in 1:12:45. Slower than my PR, but I had just done the 102-mile week previously and I felt decent about this coming off of injury. Fitness was rapidly improving at this point, and this was obviously a good stimulus, so it actually gave me a lot of confidence going into Chicago. I actually felt my limiting factor was just speed/leg turnover here, which makes sense since I slowly re-introduced speedwork after the injury. I never really had any crazy, ""see god"" workouts as far as speed goes, and I think I had maybe only hit HMP in like two separate 400m repeats workout prior to this so I was okay with the result!

For most of the block I thought I was being unrealistic trying to convince myself I could still PR at Chicago coming off of an injury, but after the half something changed. I think it was probably just a shift in my mindset knowing that I had run Chicago before, loved the course, and knew I wouldn't be slowed down by any hills (I am very weak over hills). That shift in mindset had me locked in for the last 4 weeks of training.

# Pre-race

Drove to Chicago on Friday and straight to the expo to get my packet. After \~9 hours in the car, I just wanted to get my bib and get out of there, so I probably spent a total of 10 minutes in the expo overall and then made my way to my sister's place in the city (I grew up outside of Chicago).

Saturday, I did a little shakeout run with Heartbreak and Nike and convinced my brother-in-law + my cousins (including one who was running his first marathon yesterday in Chicago) to tag along. The shakeout had a few hundred people I'd say, and was definitely a good time! Had some breakfast after the shakeout and later did an extra half mile of jogging + some strides. I've had a nagging calf issue for some time, and my calf had really tightened up this past week, so I was trying to loosen it up a bit more. From lunchtime and beyond it was all about staying off my feet, hydrating, and getting more carbs in. In bed around 9 PM and actually got some decent sleep.

Woke up at 4, had some poptarts and some gatorade, then started getting ready, Caught a train to Grant park at 5:30 and was probably in Grant Park just after 6. I grabbed a water bottle from a volunteer by a med tent, slowly sipped from that, then went to my corral to check out the area. At this point, there were definitely a good amount of people there, but it wasn't overcrowded. I hit the bathroom and then just sat on the grass for a bit before starting some stretching.

Started warming up at 6:45, and the corral started getting pretty crowded pretty quickly. I did about 10 minutes of running and then some more dynamic stretches and final checks to make sure everything was good to go. I was probably 4 rows off of the front from Corral A--I could've fought my way further ahead, but honestly I don't think it's worth it.

It wasn't necessarily super warm this morning, but you could feel that it was humid and I did feel a bit toasty standing in the corral. Obviously part of that was just standing around in a cluster of people, but it definitely felt warmer than Chicago when I ran it two years ago.

Right after the elites went off they started moving us up a bit. At one point they stopped and told us to ""stay,"" at which point this dude next to me started barking like a dog--hope that man had a good race.

Crossed the start line at 7:31!

# Race

Got out nicely and had plenty of space within the first 100m. It's easy to go out too hard in that first mile in Chicago, but right away I felt pretty comfortable and settled into a nice rhythm. Surprisingly, my GPS was working right away at the beginning. When I ran Chicago in 2022, this definitely wasn't the case. This was definitely short lived, as it was pretty erratic miles 2–3. I was manually lapping anyway, but I found for most of the race my watch had my pace about 4s faster than I ended up splitting.

The early miles of Chicago are some of my favorite, especially as we're going over the river. The crowds there are awesome, and you get some really great views of the city. These early miles flew by, and I was clicking off low to mid 5:40s, which was perfect. I thought 2:30–2:32 was ambitious given the short build, but also possible because of the flat course and because of how 5:43-5:48 had felt in recent training. It was definitely humid at the beginning though (my Strava says 87% humidity at the start), and I felt like I was sweating way too much in those first miles, despite not feeling like I was working that hard. I dumped some water on myself at the first aid station to cool off, and this definitely helped. First gel at mile 4 (every 4 miles for me).

Saw my cousins at mile 4, which gave me a nice boost. I grew up outside of Chicago, so I had some great family support out there on the course. Around this time, I spotted someone wearing a Drexel (school in Philly) singlet who I remember seeing at the Philly Distance Run. Started running with him--his name is Brandon (I'm realizing he might have posted on this sub after the Philly Distance Run)--and chatted a bit about goals. We talked about 2:30 and Brandon pointed out some other guys who were targeting that, so we kept them in our sights. 

The next miles we were clicking off low 5:40s, but when I saw a 5:39 I slowed down a bit since I didn't want to overcook myself. Brandon asked me my plan for the rest of the race, and I said I was trying to run as evenly as I could (I am a serial positive splitter). Eventually I let him go ahead of me, and I just concentrated on running mid 5:40s. I had a crazy idea that I could negative split (spoiler alert: I did not do this, but I'm getting better), so I wanted to conserve some energy in the first half. Passing through Boystown was a ton of fun with drag queens dancing on stage--the energy here was high, and I sang along to Icona Pop's ""I Love It"" as I passed through.

Crossed halfway in 1:15:27 and was feeling decent. My plan was to get to 18 and evaluate from there. The humidity had definitely dropped at this point, so I was no longer feeling like I was sweating more than I needed to. I was getting in all of my nutrition and hitting every water/Gatorade station and things were going pretty well. Heading out west, the crowds definitely thin out a bit, and I don't think it's a surprise that miles 16–20 felt the hardest for me. Pilsen, however, is always a good time, and I really enjoyed the crowds here. I need to work on my mental game here for next year--in my head I was looking to my last gel at 20 and the last 10k of the race, which sort of gave me an excuse to not push in these miles since I told myself I would push the last 10k. Saw the Heartbreak/Nike Running group at 20.5, which was a nice boost since I was wearing a Heartbreak singlet, but damn I could not make that left turn onto Cermak to save my life and I went so wide. At this point, my legs were definitely feeling it.

I did want to pick it up some more in this last 10k, but I was fighting demons, man. Had a bit of a side stitch that wasn't super severe, but just enough this late into the race that it was hard to ignore. Mentally, I was not feeling great, but I told myself I'd get to the last 5k and then go for broke. Luckily, my last gel hit right around then and I was feeling awake again.

I managed to speed up that last 5k, cutting down each mile, and damn does that feel good at the tail end of a marathon. I was passing a ton of people and the crowds were starting to pick up again. Abbott does an asshole thing where they put a ""400m to go"" sign when it's 400m to go until the last mile--luckily I knew that was coming, so I wasn't confused when I saw it. I really enjoyed the last stretch of Michigan Ave, throwing my hands up and pumping up the crowds before we made the turn onto Roosevelt. Did the same thing there before making the turn onto Columbus for the final stretch. I wish there were more people in that final stretch, but it seemed to me like not a lot of folks bought tickets for the bleachers, as they seemed quite empty in spots. Did my best to kick it in and finished in 2:32:34, almost a 4-minute PR (2:36:21 in Boston this past spring)!

Was happy with the result, especially since sub-2:35 has been a goal for some time (I wanted to be able to qualify for an American Development entry for Chicago, but the standards are now 10 minutes faster). Also felt decent about a small-ish positive split, rather than like a 6-minute positive split, which I have had in the  past.

# Post-race and What's Next

Grabbed my finisher beer, some water, a banana, and then made my way through Grant Park. I forgot how long that damn walk is before you can get to the runner reunite area or even exit Grant Park. Met up with my parents and then headed to my cousin's place for an after party!

So what's next? Well, I'm actually signed up for Philly in just under 6 weeks. This will be my first time doubling in the marathon in a single season, so I'm looking forward to seeing how my body holds up. My coach actually thinks I could PR again with an additional 6 weeks given this short build. I ran Philly last year, and I know I'm going to need to work on hills over the next weeks to feel confident about a PR attempt in November.

Thanks for reading--I'm going to go try to jog 2 miles now!

### Training

Background is I'm a 26M whose been running for about a year and a half at this point. Have not raced a ton so this was on my second marathon after I completely blew up at the SF marathon the previous year. Ran a time a bit over 4 hours which was probably due to a combination of strategic & health issues. Ran a 1:36 half only a few months before that, so was pretty confident I could have ran 3:20 - 3:30ish if my health was strong throughout the training block.

Since the SF marathon I had done pretty minimal running, just maintenance around 20 - 30MPW with no speed work. Later ran my local Turkey Trot 10k at 41.XX (PB and first 10k I've ever ran) and decided I should start preparing for another marathon. Decided on Napa with a shortened 12 week training block and used Runna to develop a plan that peaked at 62MPW on 6 runs/weeks. Weeks consisted of 2 speed days (1 internal & 1 tempo), 3 easy runs, and then a long run where usually half the miles would be at marathon pace. 

Most of my metrics (Runna & Runalyze) were forecasting a 3.05ish finish, but during one of my long runs I had about a month prior I managed to run 24 miles at an average pace of 7:15 so felt like I had some room on race day to push to a 3:00.

### Pre-race
Relatively small race so nothing too crazy in terms of logistics. Carb load calculators were asking me to target ~850 carbs/day which was way too much, so just ate candy whenever I could throughout the day including pastries or fruit here and there. 

Day of the race didn't have the stomach to eat anything so just did a Maurten 320 drink mix and had a friend drop me off at the marathon stop line. Drop off was a super smooth process as they have a specific drop off point so just a constant flow of cars going in and out.

### Race
Was a little surprised at how much smaller this race was than SF as I easily walked up towards the front and placed myself next to the 3:00 pacer. Overall strategy here was just to hold on as long as I could and if I had it in my to kick it in the last 10K to get as far below 3:00 as I could. Fueling strategy was going to be a Maurten 160 every 4 miles and a extra caffeinated gel or two if I felt myself slipping.

Miles 1 - 3: Soon as we started off the pace felt really fast, most likely a result of doing minimal warm ups outside of a quick 1 minute jog. Felt like I would probably get dropped, but first few miles always feel bad on any run. 

Miles 4 - 7 At this point I'd really settled into my stride and was feeling comfortable. Lot of mental reassurance and I felt confident that holding on to the 3:00 pacer would be possible. I felt like the first 6 or 7 miles of the marathon felt pretty cambered and I needed to decide between running tangents vs running on flatter ground. Was already overrunning by about 0.2 miles at point and ended up 0.4 miles over by the end.

Miles 8 - 20 all felt kind of the same, sun started to come out so it was warming up so I started to pour an extra cup of water on myself at the aid stations. There isn't a ton of crowd support throughout the race as there are designated areas, but the areas with crowds are pretty lively and definitely perked my mood up. Really need to mention though that mile 20 is a pretty long uplift which is brutal at that point in the race. 

At mile 21 - I decided to start kicking past the pacer to push for sub 3:00. Felt like my effort levels were 10/10, but I was only shaving maybe 5 seconds off each mile. One mistake is at this point I was feeling pretty sick of gels so I opted out of eating another one, even though there was definitely enough race to justify one. 

At mile 23 - The finish was so close, but my calves were starting to have slight spasms every half mile or so. Was super worried I'd fully cramp up, but at this point all I could do was keep running. Ran one of my slowest miles here at a 6:51 pace and at the time it felt like I was running through molasses. Eventually I made the last turn and saw the finish line and barely held on to kick it in with about a minute to spare. The post race refreshments were pretty decent, they had hot soup (minestrone) which was hype.

### Post-race

Was super pumped to have hit my stretch goal especially since it was a huge fitness improvement over the 10k I ran just a few months ago. Really think running my long runs with half the miles at marathon pace provided huge gains in addition to have 2 speed sessions every week. 

Currently mapping out what my training will look like as my next big race is doing to be Chicago where I'm hoping to BQ and go <2:50. Thinking of doing a 5k/10 block and then jumping into Pfitzinger's 18/70 plan, but would love any input from anyone else on how to maximize my training until then.

I started running in May and last week I finished my first ever marathon with a time of 4:48! I should start with the disclaimer this post is NOT meant to be taken as a recommendation or example of a good approach to training for a first marathon. I think a lot of things went right for me that easily could have gone wrong, and I feel very lucky to have stayed injury-free and finish the race. One of the most helpful elements in preparing for my race was reading the Reddit posts of others who came from similar training backgrounds, and I'm hoping this post can be a data point for other people switching from weight training to distance running for the first time (hence the clickbait title). I'll try to note what I think worked well or what I'd do differently, but I'd love input as well :)

**BACKGROUND**

27M, 5'10, 220lbs, \~20% bodyfat. I played team sports in high school but for the last 8 years I've pretty much just been weight training off and on (Totals: 365/440/585) with a little rec soccer, frisbee, and hiking on occasion. Aside from huffing and puffing in the gym during high volume sets and some occasional sprints in indoor soccer games over the winter, I really had no cardio base heading into this training block. 

I wear minimalist barefoot shoes (Xero Shoes, etc) daily, so I picked up a pair of Altra Escalante Racers for long runs. I wore Vivobarefoot Primus Trail FGs for most of my shorter runs.

I ran a 26:16 5k on my own as a baseline to set my initial training paces (10:45 goal race pace, 11:30-12:00 long run pace).

I later ran a 2:06 half marathon in early August (\~8 weeks before marathon) which reassured me that 4:50 was a good target.

**TRAINING PLAN**

I tried to follow [Marathon Handbooks 20 Week Training Plan](https://marathonhandbook.com/trainingplans/20-week-marathon-training-plan/). I chose this plan because 1) I wanted to still lift regularly and it only had me running 4 days a week. 2) it had a nice spreadsheet with total weekly mileage that seemed doable. 3) it didn't have any speed workouts, just straight pace/training/long runs. I didn't think I had the time to build speed AND endurance before the race, so I just focused on working up to the distance. 

Looking back, I should have changed my current habits and schedule to fit a marathon training plan, not the other way around. If I could do it over again, I'd forget about all lifting goals, stick to 1 or 0 lower body/core days a week, and put the rest of my recovery/time towards getting better at running. 

  
**TRAINING**

My biggest challenge during training was judging recovery. I was accustomed to lifting programs where each muscle group gets 48-72 hours off before being trained again, and where soreness=not recovered. This made it difficult to judge whether I ought to proceed with a schedule run while sore/fatigued, or if more progress would be made by giving it another rest day. Some weeks I skipped runs, and other weeks my solution to this was to combine the Wednesday Training running with either Tuesday or Friday, resulting in basically 1 short, 1 medium, and 1 long run per week. This made those medium length runs even more taxing which fueled the ""am I recovered in time for another run?"" question even more.

My goal for future blocks is to get more comfortable running one tired legs, and to do more easy runs throughout the week. Ultimately I think I just didn't have the fitness to execute the plan I had laid out for myself initially, and I wonder how 4-5 easier runs during the week would have served me vs the 3 taxing weekly runs I ended up doing. I suspect it would have allowed me to up my volume a bit, and result in fewer skipped runs.

[Here is my mileage breakdown over the last 6 months](https://preview.redd.it/5zozo4cplytd1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7f1109db2e7b218599e9a3f3f224b3fd3778c2cf)

As you can see by this Strava graph, I fell short of my goal mileage on many weeks, but still managed about 430 Miles before race day, and to hit all of my long runs. Not reflected in the graph is a number of easy cross training days on the bike. The big drop in September was a week-long 50 mile backpacking trip with lots of elevation at +6000 ft altitude, so that was a taxing week despite not getting formal running in.

My training goals in order of importance were:

1. Stay injury free. I knew that having to take 2-3 weeks off to heal up from an injury would likely be enough to push my training plan into completely unrealistic territory.
2. Execute the long runs as planned, and with proper fueling. Based on what I had read, these seemed like the best practice for race day and I knew I needed to dial in fueling before being out there for 4+ hours.
3. Get as close to weekly mileage totals as possible. As I mentioned, I stopped running some of the shorter runs as written and instead just attempted to fit in the mileage while recovering before and after my long runs.

The fueling strategy that worked best for me was 300 calories of gels/bloks per hours + 12oz of gatorade + water as needed. I tried the ""1 gel every 45 minutes"" recommendation on GUs and even one every half hour, but that wasn't nearly enough. I am fortunate to not have any stomach issues with those products at that rate.

I suspect that my background in weight training meant that my joints and muscles were better prepared for ramping up training intensity quickly than someone truly going couch to marathon, but I still knew it wasn't smart to jump into a program like this. I read a lot about gradually increasing weekly mileage and knew in the back of my mind that I was taking a risk.

My only real injury was a case of shin splints/shin pain after coming back from that backpacking trip. I hit a 20 mile long run that week and it was painful to walk for the whole week afterwards. At that point I started my taper a little earlier and decided to replace everything with my long runs/pre-race shakeout run with elliptical. That was a tough decision mentally as I already felt unprepared after having ""missed"" one of my biggest training weeks for that trip, but I read a lot of helpful advice on here: ""better to be 10% undertrained than 1% overtrained"", ""you can't improve your time in the last 3 weeks of training, but you can definitely screw it up"", ""better to be undertrained than underecovered"", etc. That ended up working out and my shins healed up perfectly by race day.

  
**TAPER**

One thing I underestimated was just how hard the taper would be on me mentally. After working out 6-7 days/week for months and months (and regularly for years), taking 3 weeks almost entirely off was a huge hit to my mental health. I knew that taper crazies were a thing, and that general endorphin withdrawal was a factor, but it was hard not to feel like I was losing all the fitness I had built up. My last proper long run had been 4 weeks ago and my easy taper runs just felt so difficult.

A lot of the advice I read on here was to trust the plan and reassure myself with all the work I'd done beforehand. I felt like my plan wasn't great in the first place and that I failed to execute it properly, so I guess what I'm realizing while writing this is that I didn't deserve to feel prepared anyway lol.

I doubt that any marathon training block ever goes perfectly, but in the future I'll at least have the ""okay this is what I felt like tapering and the race went fine"" data point to rely on.

**RACE DAY**

It was hard to plan for a first marathon, which is probably why there are so many ""what should my goal pace be?"" posts all the time. My conservative goal was to just run the 26 miles at faster than my long run pace (so sub 5 hours) which a secondary goal of sub 4:50, which felt right based on my half marathon 8 weeks prior (2:06).

I knew the biggest dangers to my goals were 1) starting out too fast and 2) under-fueling and bonking, so I structured my plan around minimizing those risks.

The weather was perfect, and the plan was to run the first half of the race with my two friends and the 4:50 pacer (11:02 pace). At that point we'd reassess how we were feeling and speed up accordingly. My friends were much faster than I was, so to myself I was planning on maybe just sticking with the 11:02 pacer as they turned on the jets.

At the 13.1 mark I was feeling amazing, better than the 13 mile mark on any long run. My shins weren't bothering me at all and I had feasted on Birthday Cake and Salted Caramel GUs exactly as planned, even picking up a few Twizzlers from kiddos in the cheering sections :). This led to my big mistake of sticking with my friends as they sped up for the second half, all the way to mile 19.

As you can see below, this meant miles 14-18 were the fastest of my whole race. My measured max heart rate is 199 so I knew that 185 was high but that maybe I could push it for the remaining 2ish hours. By mile 18 though, I was starting to fatigue and so returned to my 11ish pace.

This worked well until the last uphill, which was down and then up a big bridge. I pulled/tweaked my hamstring on the very first step on the bridge. The last 3 miles probably look like a bonk, but really I was just struggling to hobble that last stretch without hurting my hamstring further.

[Here are my splits. My HRM is 199 bpm for reference.](https://preview.redd.it/qgrzxsjazytd1.jpg?width=921&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a17185fedfb1175746d731ad9a2767b843243a1)

The volunteers and cheering sections throughout the race were nothing but incredible. I had read about race day environments and even got to experience one myself with my half marathon earlier that summer, but it's hard to express just how much that support meant as I pushed myself through that second half. I'm definitely going to pay it forward at the next big race in my area, and if you're someone that volunteers/supports at races, thank you :).

**POST-RACE REFLECTIONS**

* Switching from being an advanced trainee (in lifting) to a novice is an incredibly humbling and valuable experience. My proudest accomplishment from this experience is learning to not be so hard on myself, and that has already benefited me in other areas of life.
* Running creates a fascinating relationship with weather. I found the humidity, heat, sun, wind, etc impacting me in ways I never had to even think about in regular life. I really got to FEEL what differences in my environment felt like. I love that.
* Running is an awesome way to get to know your city. I explored nooks and crannies of neighborhoods that I'd otherwise have had no reason to visit.
* Someone said marathons are 5 times as hard as half marathons, not twice as hard. That feels about right.
* The running community is something special. Whether it's online discussions, other runners on the trail, or the volunteers/supporters on race day, there's nothing but support for people at all levels. It's pretty awesome to see so many people so focused on everyone improving themselves.
* Body Glide is worth its weight in gold.

**WHAT'S NEXT?**

* Two big resources that I really wished I had had during this training block were 1) knowing what it feels like to run 26 and 2) time. I have both of those now, so I've really got no excuse not to try another one :)
* My tentative plan for the next year is:
   * 3 months light running/lifting and losing weight - I definitely have 10-15 pounds to lose and I'm curious to see what that does to my speed and endurance.
   * 3 months building up some speed - maybe a 5k or 10k training program?
   * 3 months training for a half marathon - 1:50 feels like a good goal (and one subject to change).
   * 3-4 months training for a marathon in Oct or Nov 2025. Is sub 4 realistic? Won't know until the half is over I guess. I mostly just want to put a proper training block together.
   * Try out some higher stack shoes. Maybe the Torin 7s or regular Escalantes? I wonder if this will help my recovery on easy/long days.

Thanks again for everyone who takes the time to post and comment on this subreddit. It was really helpful to hear people talking about their own experiences, and hopefully you got something from mine :)"

**Training:**

Coming off of my fall half in Grand Rapids, I felt like I was ready to take on the marathon. I'd put in a handful of 70 mile weeks over summer 2024, and thought I'd be able to handle the demands of a proper training block. The day after my half, I noticed a post here on r/advancedrunning about the McKirdy Micro Marathon Breaking3 series on a flat, fast course in NY with bottle support for every athlete. Seemed like a great opportunity to turn in a fast time, so I signed up in late October and figured I'd sort the rest later.

The week after my half, I turned in 33 miles, then continued to reverse taper, logging 48, 51, 56, and 61 miles per week before starting Pfitzinger's 18 week plan that peaks at 70 miles in a week (Pfitz 18/70). That plan starts with a 54 mile week, which felt easy (a step down from 61 the previous week).

The build was largely good. I picked up a couple of small bugs from the kid (colds, I think) but ran through them without issue. Winters in my area come with a few challenges wrt running - ice, snow, bitterly cold wind, and darkness. For ice and sometimes with cold wind, I opted for a treadmill. On snowy days, I mostly kept my runs as is - there wasn't much fresh snowfall this build near my key workouts (that I can recall). I do remember a couple of bitterly cold spells that had me trotting ""recovery"" miles around 0 Fahrenheit. That was unpleasant. Somewhere, I have a photo of sweat that formed a sizable icicle off of my sunglasses.

Most of my long runs and long run workouts were around a local 1.22 mi lake loop. They went pretty well. My long runs were cold and sometimes windy, but I figured with perhaps some better luck on wind and more luck on the race day temps that 2:50 was potentially within reach. I was happy to share a couple of those long runs with a local friend; it's nice to have company on the long slogs.

I averaged 64.74 miles per week in the 16 weeks leading into an abbreviated 2 week taper without getting injured or missing a day (other than the occasional weather or schedule-induced shuffling - I got it all in); I'm proud of that.

**Prerace:**

Race week began on Sunday with a day off - I had gotten used to long runs on Saturdays and Sundays off for the build. These are ordinarily uneventful since I'm not doing much, but kiddo started coming down with a cold again, making me quite nervous.

Monday had 7 recovery miles in the worst wind I've run in for this build. I made the mistake of wearing AirPods for this early morning jaunt - a nasty gust of wind yanked an AirPod out of my ear and sent it flying into the 5AM darkness of some farmer's (fenced) field. Never found it.

Anyway - the week didn't get much better from there. It was a 2 day workweek, but came with some surprising additional work stressors - possibly exacerbated by my taper tantrums. My kiddo's upper respiratory infection turned into (her first) asthma attack on Tuesday night, leading to a middle-of-the-night trip to the emergency room. She's fine, but I was a childhood asthmatic who has had his share of stresses associated with the chronic condition (sidebar: my asthma came back 3 years ago after being a non-factor for 20 years. A couple of months after that first awful asthma attack of adulthood, I picked up running more seriously than I ever had previously...). That got in my head.

Anyway, Wednesday was a day off of work for me, but my head was occupied with the kiddo's condition and some additional work things.

Meanwhile, the perfect race day forecast I had clocked 7 days out was deteriorating into a warm day (high 50s to start; 65 to finish).

I got on the plane on Thursday morning and made my way to the hotel. Thursday into Friday I had my 3rd consecutive crappy night of sleep and opted to find some melatonin for the last night heading into the race. I also needed to find a singlet, since I forgot to pack one. Oh, and I forgot my sunglasses. At least I remembered my race shoes?

I got an excellent night of sleep from 7:30 PM to just before 4AM heading into the race. I was hopeful this was a good sign that I could hang in there according to plan.

**Race:**

The race is a time trial for a couple of hundred folks who want to break 3 hours. It's hosted on a pancake flat looped course; 2.95 mile loops x 8 then one more short loop, 2.6 miles. Each athlete gets to prepare 8 bottles for the race and you grab the bottles each loop starting with loop 2. I've never raced a marathon before, but I figured I'd need a lot of calories, so I prepared 8 bottles with Maurten 320 and taped a Maurten 100 gel to each bottle.

That's 420 calories every 2.95 miles. All you experienced marathoners smarter than I am can see what is coming...

The race forecast was initially going to be in the 40s (Fahrenheit) throughout. Turned out to be 50s and 60s - 65 by my finish. Some of the other runners and I were kvetching about this at bib pickup. It was especially angering since every day beforehand and several days after in the forecast are all much cooler. What can you do?

So I lined up with the 2:50 group and we were off. We had 2 pacers - 1 through the half and the other stuck around til 17ish. This was a nice experience; about 10-12 of us clopping along at the same pace. It took guesswork out of pacing. I just needed to keep the tall guy with ""Pacer"" on his singlet at the same distance. Easy.

I mean... With folks at different heights, that means different cadences and gaits. Everyone got clipped a few times, I think. But mostly, it was good. By the end of the first hour, it was feeling uncomfortably warm.

I felt great through 13.1 and good to ok through 17. I was starting to notice muscular fatigue around 16 or so, which was concerning since there's still a lot of race to run then.

I grabbed my bottles for the most part the first 5 times through the tables. I'd take down about half - maybe more - of the carb mix, eat the gel, and keep moving. They also had water, which I grabbed here and there to drink and dump on my head. Oh! I also had buffered electrolyte capsules...I took 3 of those in the first 2 hours after only trying 1 during a training run. It was a late attempt to deal with the heat. Something new on race day. I suspect this was a mistake.

Around 18.5-19 miles, the relative effort spiked dramatically. I went from feeling okay to concluding that 2:50 wasn't happening, to wondering if I needed to DNF by the time I was 8km from the finish (21.25 miles in). It's kind of amazing how quickly I went from ""good"" to ""this is worse than any run I can recall"".

I was in the middle of my penultimate lap and alternating between trying to get back onto pace and dropping towards 7 minute pace or slower. With 3.6 miles to go, I took a walk break. I can't remember the last time I took a walk break during a race. There were a few of these - not very long, but the first one was quite discouraging, and 3.6 miles seemed like a marathon of its own with the temp continuing to climb.

I skipped my bottle on the last pass through the tables, grabbed a water bottle (provided by the race), took a sip, and immediately realized that I had a bigger (gastrointestinal) problem than continuing to run at a reasonable clip. I found a porta-potty and was met with the lowlight of my day - did I spend my last 4 months on this for nothing? Did I leave my wife with a sick kid for 3 days so I could DNF in a porta-potty 1500 miles from home?

As I exited the bathroom, I remembered that the race cutoff was 3:15, and I've never run a marathon before so anything official is an automatic PR and I can do better next time. I begrudgingly sucked down an emergency gel I had in my half tights, took a swig of water, and went back to trotting. Checking my watch, it seemed like I could get in under 3:02 going a bit faster than 8 minute pace. I kept pace with another runner and struggle bussed along.

I think around 2k to go is when I realized that I'd be under 3:01, which I found funny. Close to sub 3, but not quite. I kept the other runner I'd found a steady distance ahead of me and let the hundreds of meters go by. I considered another walk break with 1200 to go, but decided to keep slogging away. Too many people around to walk here.

Passing the 26 mile mark, I figured I could sustain my misery for another 2 minutes and be all right. I was going to get a finish time! I saw the official race clock pass 3 hours with me tens of meters back from the line, and a race official yelled, ""REMEMBER YOUR CHIP TIME!!!"" Oh yeah. I mustered the saddest kick you've ever seen and finished in 2:59:58. Sub 3 on the first marathon out.

**Postrace:**

This isn't the race I envisioned, planned on, or wanted, but I'm happy with the outcome and result all things considered. I need to work on fatigue resistance in my abdominal muscles, hamstrings, and glutes. I should lose some non functional mass, as I'm larger than most of the faster runners. I spent 2:25 walking and 3:15 in the potty. My in-race fueling strategy was clearly not right. But I'm a sub 3 marathoner, and had a solid debut I can build from.

As I sat on a park bench trying to collect myself post race, I overheard someone angrily talk-yelling into their cellphone to their partner, ""I QUIT! I'm serious! I'm going to sell my GPS watch on Facebook marketplace; I'm done with this...""

I probably had a better day than that guy. Among others. In a field of 147, 35 people DNF'd. Woof.

So I did not get the outcome I was hoping for, but I was humbled by the event and the distance. Unlike my first 10km (from 5km) or my first half marathon (from 10km), I was surprised when my body failed in completely unexpected ways, telegraphing to me that this is a different game from the shorter races. It's *exciting* to be a beginner and a novice. I'm hopeful that I can learn from this experience and feed forward towards better preparation and ***MUCH*** better race day execution.

Anyway - lots to learn and to improve from. On to the next one.

**Lessons for the near-to-medium future:**

* I'm not sure if it was the heat, my shitty fueling strategy (pun intended), or just a lack of experience - but my legs were cooked after \~ 18.5 miles, and it seemed to come out of nowhere. I didn't feel like I was working that hard for the first 2 hours, and then very suddenly the effort skyrocketed. My best guess is that fueling + heat meant that I wasn't actually able to uptake many of the carbs I was consuming, so I bonked b/c my body wasn't processing the fuel. In any case, there are a few things I can do to address this - the first one is to establish better muscular endurance. My muscles just ran out of juice \~2:10 in. This means more lifting. And probably more hills. Even for flat-ish races. Hill sprints and likely some hillier long runs.
* Slow down a bit during hot conditions to make it more likely that I can take in calories early. I probably should have started at 2:55 and inhaled more calories in the opening half to avoid the wall.
* Lose non-functional mass. At 183 lbs, I'm one of the larger runners logging miles at my speed(s). I can find some weight to lose that would help my paces, race times, fueling, etc.
* Dietary adjustment. I did a 3 day carb load - 665g of carbohydrates/day for 3 days leading up to the race. This may sound like a lot, but I didn't feel particularly full. I even felt hungry at times on the 3rd day. I believe this is because my normal diet has more calories and carbs than I need day in and day out. So, I'll eat fewer bagels, bread from the bread machine, and bananas to prioritize more lentils, chickpeas, and other fiber-rich filling foods (with more protein and fat than carbs).
* Get used to running with others. I think there's a local Citius running group on Saturdays that I'll join after the reverse taper. It was generally nice to race with others, but it took a bit for me to get used to running in the pack. I could tell a couple of others were struggling to figure out how to not step on others or get stepped on too. Some more experience here would be nice - plus I can pick others' brains and learn from their mistakes.
* Remember to turn off autolap on every mile before the race. Because I didn't do that, my splits are impossible to parse (since I was also manually lapping the mile markers and the lap splits...)
* Don't improv with electrolytes.
* Melatonin for sleep while away from home can work out okay if timed well.
* Make a checklist for travel and for race day. This is more important if enviromental stressors are more intense than usual.
* The marathon is a long race - in distance and in time. There's time to recover, even if the wheels start to or completely fall off.
* A 2 week taper is fine. A 3 week taper is probably too much. Pfitz prescribed a 3 week taper, but I ended up with a 70 mile week 3 weeks out because reasons. I don't think this was a problem; the 2 week aggressive taper was just fine for me physically. An extra week would have been overkill.
* Figure out how to better manage travel stress. I think that contributed to some sleep and GI distress in the last couple of days leading up.
* Body glide works. No chafing issues in spite of the heavy sweat from warm and more-humid-than-usual conditions.

Finally:

And maybe most importantly, marathon preparation requires a lot of time and energy. From me - sure, but also from my family who don't get to realize many of the benefits. Nevermind the tightly wound mental and emotional state (a stream of cranky updates on various sore body parts, panicking anytime someone coughs within 3 miles of me, etc) exacerbated as race day approaches with a whole new set of worries to boot (carb loading, salt intake, weather reports). Early mornings, late evenings, and Saturday long runs have an impact on family life enhanced by my anxious approach to…damn near everything. My wife and child didn’t ask for this, and they get none of the dopamine that comes with increased fitness or crossing a finish line. I’m immensely grateful to them both for happily supporting my silly, arbitrary goals. They also decorated my race day bottles for me and held down the home front on a particularly chaotic race week. I’m so, so thankful to my family for enabling my ridiculous pursuits.

Next up - some time off to let the body recover, then reverse taper towards some shorter distance races before gearing up for another 26.2 this autumn. I registered for my fall race the day after my marathon. Typical.

### Training
50 miles per week.
Mostly norwegian singles method, but replaced one workout with a track session (most recent 7x800, 2:50r starting at 3:35 pace cutting down to 3:25). Why? Because I like to run fast on a track once in a while.
Did my first sub20 5k in a random run 1.5 weeks ago (19:46) - in pitch black darkness running on gravel with potholes.
Feeling fitter now than ever.

### Pre-race
The days leading up to the race were super rainy and cold. Day before the race I actually got a sore throat and clogged nose. Perfect timing. HRV the night before the race plunged to 25 from a regular 80 avg. My explanation for what is about to happen.

### Getting to the race 
Stayed close to Rossio. Took the subway to Areeiro where I got on the train which brings you to the start. All pretty packed. My bib said to take the first train but I had no intention to stand in the cold for a long time while I am sickish already. Left Rossio at 7:30 and got to the start box with 15 minutes to spare - even had some time to do warm up strides.
Organisation was a bit lackluster. At the train stop there was one hidden sheet of paper telling you where to go. Lots of confused people.
Getting into the start boxes was also very obscure. Still don't know how I was supposed to do it properly. Jumped a fence and dodged two seperators and got to the front. Maybe caused by me leaving later than indicated.

### Race
There was a starting gun. I believe, might have heard something. Please somebody tell me if you heard it or not.
I was in the 5th row and somehow there were still loads of people in front of me, including the 6 min pacer. I don't understand why somebody puts slower pacers at the front to pace according to gun time.
On the bridge there is a long grid on the floor. You can see down to the water from there. Since I am scared of heights it got my HR going. The views are very nice though and reminded me of the NYC marathon start.
First kms are downhill and I had to focus to back off  a gear or two. Still split a 20:34 first 5k and got a 40:54 10k in there. Felt very good.
Until I did not. At km 12 I started to feel a jump in RPE and my throat became completely congested. My HR dropped and I started to taste some blood. Not good. Took out some speed to check what is happening. Maybe I flew a bit too close to the sun? Even if I did that does not explain the throat. Decided to let targets go out the window and jog it home. Slowed down to marathon - easier long run pace.
At km19 I did some math and realized that I could still break my PR. Sped up to make it home slightly under. Recovered at least some goal.

### Post-race
Logistics at Lisbon half can be challenging. Finish is a bit out of the city. There are some busses and a train. Both struggle to accomodate the amount of runners.
I somehow managed to feel worse than after a full marathon. Almost fainted in the train and shivered uncontrollably. Found a bar serving me 4 satchels of sugar dilluted with an espresso which helped me to get home.

### Take aways
Don't race sick. Even if you start out as planned it will come to bite you. I am probably now facing a week off.

I’m typing this as I sit in on the train back home to Boston contemplating my running future. This was my fifth Philly Marathon and by far my worst. Do I retire? Or try again next year? 

Let’s get the facts out of the way -- I ran it in around 5:30. I missed my A goal (4:40) by 45 minutes! I figured my worst case scenario would be that I glide in just under 5 hours. I was way off unfortunately. It was a long day. 

It was my first marathon since the [2019 Philly Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/e16r6l/2019_philadelphia_marathon_race_report_mildly/) (4:20) and I’m wondering if it should be my last.

It was one of those races where I quickly knew that it was not going to be my day. The first couple of miles were fine but I could tell around mile 5 or 6 that my legs just didn’t have it. When I do these very long runs I run it in a medium gear and I can usually call on another gear or two if I need it early in the race. This time, by mile 7 I knew it wasn’t there. I just tried to keep my pace (10:45), but I should have known that wasn’t going to happen. 

I’m not sure what is going on. I just fell off this whole cycle. I bonked on many of my runs and in general felt dead legged except on a few glorious days. My times never really came down, and I knew this was a red flag. 

I got in a couple of weeks of 40-45 miles following a variation of Hal Higdon’s Intermediate II marathon plan. I ran 4 days a week instead of 5 for most of the weeks, but I would just add extra miles to the 4 days I ran. I never skipped a long run, except for the 12 miler during my taper. I played hockey one day a week instead of that run. 

My pace during the long runs was wildly inconsistent. One 20 miler was 10:42, the next was 12:04 and the last was 11:20. My body never felt like it recovered well. I’m in my mid-40s, don’t sleep well and am about 25 pounds overweight, but I didn’t think my fall off would be this extreme. 

I wanted to run the whole thing but by the time I got to Manayunk I felt cooked. By mile 21 I had to do a walk/run, 65 seconds walking/65 seconds running. When I got to 25.2 I decided to run the last mile and grind it out.

Some race thoughts: 

1. It wasn’t that cold, but I always appreciate that they have the warm up tents. The security lines were crazy long and slow. I ended up going to a different entrance from where the shuttle bus dropped me off as I found a shorter line. But the line was still fairly long just before the 7 am start. Not good. 
2. Speaking of backups, I got in line to the port-o-potty at 6:25 and didn’t get to one until 6:55. This is an issue at every race but it sucked.  
3. I was in the last corral and we didn’t go until 45 minutes after the start. I know it's a big race and there’s probably not much that race organizers could do, but standing in a corral for 45 minutes kinda sucked. So yeah, a lot of waiting around. 
4. The Philly crowd was A+! They are always the best part of the race. I put my name on my shirt and it is always so cool to have people screaming your name. At one point some college bros were doing a chant. 
   1. The few other times I’ve run there were always furries in Fairmount Park and I was sad that I didn’t see them there this year. But take heart! I saw them doing booty dances near Manayunk so all was right in the universe.
5. The route itself is really gorgeous. It’s an amazing city!
6. So many fun signs and I can’t remember many because I was suffering and just trying to stay upright. A few said “Rats don’t run this city, you do” -- is that a local reference? Or are they just a lot of rats? Another one said “Leo would have stopped at 25” which made me laugh. 
7. Big shout out to my lovely gf who was in Manayunk for me, and also the finish line and was shepherding me around as I was barely ambulatory at best.

Of course I had to get a photo on the Rocky steps at the Art Museum but just getting there felt like it took another mile to get around the security fencing. I took the shuttle bus to the hotel but of course the shuttle didn’t take me to the hotel, but rather a couple of blocks away so I got in more walking. 

I am doing a step competition at work so I guess this was all a blessing in disguise? And the hotel had a severe lack of hot water so my shower left me feeling like a popsicle, which felt like an appropriate end to the day. 

No worries though, I got a cheesesteak from Jim’s so all was not lost. 

So, do I retire? Or do I dig in and try again next year? 

Ah fuck it -- see ya next year Philly. "

I’ve greatly benefitted from this community and achieved all my race goals, and I do believe in mental race day simulation / preparedness, i.e. knowing exactly what to expect (or no suprises on race day), so here’s my contribution:

**Useful resources:**

* **Full race video:**[ Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X3qCnSj_qI)
* Public transport map:[ BVG Map](https://www.bvg.de/en/connections/network-maps-and-routes)
* Start area 2024:[ Map](https://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/fileadmin/media/events/berlinmarathon/fotos/Strecke/PDF/BM24_Start_Ziel.pdf)
* 2024 Course:[ Map](https://www.bmw-berlin-marathon.com/fileadmin/media/events/berlinmarathon/fotos/Strecke/PDF/BM24_Strecke_Laeufer.pdf)

**Pre-Race:**

* Set your target finish time in your event account to get a suitable starting block.
* Checkout Berlin Running Crews for shakeout runs:[ Running Crews](https://runningcrews.com/).
* Your bib doubles as a public transport pass zone  ABC (Th-Sun, including airport DB transit).
* Expo at Platz der Luftbrücke (U6). Arrive early (I went Thursday) and expect around 75 minutes to get in, grab your bib, and leave. You’ll walk 4-5000 steps through the expo. ”They” make you walk through the whole area.
* Sightseeing? Take a boat on the Spree river, hop on off bus or use e-bikes/e-scooters to save your legs.
* In 2023 DB trains in Germany had a [63% on time punctuality.](https://fortune.com/europe/2024/07/03/german-railway-system-deutsche-bahn-punctuality-national-embarrassment-euro-2024-underinvestment/)
* Don‘t expect to be able to pay for amounts <10-20€ [by card or contactless](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/08/30/germany-is-hopelessly-addicted-to-cash/), in particular for drinks/food and small vendors, even if there appears to be a card machine present it might be not working.
* Supermarkets are closed on Sundays in Germany, besides the few ones inside train stations such as Hauptbahnhof.
* There is a REWE supermarket at the BER Airport.
* My favorite local pre and post run food: Get a real full-sized fresh pretzel or ""Laugenstange"" (1) from a decent real local bakery (baked in the store), or (2) the chain ""Ditsch"" at train stops and stations or (3) chain bakery (baked and then delivered)/supermarket.

**Race Day Logistics:**

* Stay near Hauptbahnhof, Brandenburger Tor, or Potsdamer Platz, or anywhere with direct inner city line S-Bahn/U5 access. Avoid trying to change to the U5 at Alexanderplatz or later westbound — it’s massively overcrowded on race day as there are no extra trains for the event and you really do risk missing the start.
* S-Bahn is more reliable than the U-Bahn on race day, because you have multiple lines (I.e more capacity) that go to Hauptbahnhof though U5 to Bundestag is the best stop to access the start, around 200m from the entrance. You can change into U5 from Hauptbahnhof for one stop to Bundestag.
* Plan 15-20 extra minutes on race day due to overall public transport crowding, and trains needing to stop longer at stations. E-scooters or bikes can be useful alternatives for the last stretch. Taxi, Uber cannot reach the start area.
* Check your connection for the race day on the [BVG website](https://www.bvg.de/en/connections/connection-search) in advance as the race affects the whole network beyond the course itself from Saturday onwards (skater‘s race).

**Entering the Start:**

* Expect chaos, stressful vibes, excitement and the literal shit show.
* Closest entrance: U5 Bundestag. It’s a bit confusing to find the entrance gates, as there are no clear overhead signs, so take the paper map from the expo, a phone photo, or memorize the layout. Entering through the main gates opposite the Reichstag building (this is the main entrance) took about 10 minutes for waiting and security. There are 20 or so gates at this main entrance. 
* I wasn’t allowed to enter with a plastic bag and had to carry my 0.3l plastic bottle and pre race gel in my hand. Other confiscated items included aluminium cans like Red Bull.
* Expect a minimum 20-30 minutes to reach your starting block in brisk walking from the entrance due to crowding at security checks and overall chaos and memorize the way from the entrance to your block, so you don't stress and burn calories unnecessarily.
* 2024 it was around 8 celsius before the start. I brought a rain poncho and made another poncho by cutting a hole into an emergency blanket and use single-use handwarmers before the start and into 2-3km. You can donate clothing at the very start, throwing it towards the volunteers and into the bins. 
* Due to overcrowding, you might not be able to stand in close proximity to a pacer before / at the start in the block and might have to catch up after the start, or choose to wait for the next ones. 

**Toilets:**

* In the start area portable toilet lines were insane (probably 20-50 minutes). Some urinals are available, and the bushes might be a better option for both number one and two — bring toilet paper.
* Besides the toilets at the very entrance, there are toilets and urinals all the way right next to the corrals as indicated in the map.
* Alternative: There is a clean public toilet at Hauptbahnhof (cash / card payment).
* Alternative: Regional (RE) trains such as the Airport train feature singular toilets, basically all besides the S-Bahn and U-Bahn have toilets and they do stop between Hauptbahnhof and many inner city stops, such as Friedrichstraße or Ostkreuz.

**Race Experience:**

* My race starting at group C was not at all  less crowded than this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X3qCnSj_qI) at a 4h pace, just faster and actually felt more consistently crowded and over capacity than the video.
* Overcrowding is real. Even with a 9:25 start, I experienced lots of “swimming” through crowds. Expect shoulder to shoulder running and the occasional elbow as well as group/social running in front of you. Be ready to zigzag. However, there are many broad streets where passing on the edges is (comparatively) easy. The ideal course is spraypainted 80% of the course distance with three addidas-sponsored blue lines on the course. Nevertheless, expect mentally to continuously being slowed down or at the very least to dedicate energy to navigating through the course at ""over""-capacity.
* Overcrowding will not stop. Actually from 25km or so onwards there’s more variation in the pace around you, as there is both stopping, walking, and throwing up, as well as overtaking. It becomes messy and disgraceful. You will be forced to slow down due to unexpected behavior in front of you, and if pushing, pick up your pace again, be (mentally) challenged by asking yourself whether you should really push or take it easy, seeing and hearing and feeling hundreds of people struggle. Expect these disassociations and distractions raising those ""voices"" of doubt in your head. It is hard to stay in your zone / flow.
* Watch out for obstacles like middle isles with little steps, road blocks (for cars to avoid parking), bike parking rails, tram tracks (slippery), and debris like discarded clothes, bottles and gels. Watch out for hard plastic cups and bottles.
* The course is 100% asphalt, although sometimes and towards the pavement there might some (uneven) cobblestones.
* Check the km for the stations and write them down on your wrist etc. The stations (5,9,12…) always come at or couple of hundred/s of meters after their km indication, so don't fuel when you expect a station but when you see one. They are long and you will make manage to get water / maurten 160.
* At water stations, the crowds can be chaotic. Aim for stations on the left side — when they are there (there are not always both right and left stations, about 30-40%), they’re less crowded on the left.
* Cups are see-through elastic plastic, 220 or so ml, 30-70% filled. Depends on the volunteer.  
* At the Maurten depot 27.5km you can take multiple gels. At km 28 there will be water (none at 27.5km). 
* Some cyclists and pedestrians don’t respect the course, so stay alert. Some people cross the street and stop somewhere in the middle. Some people cheering will run into the course to hug someone or give them water or something else. Expect the possibility of physical contact.
* I remember three fire fighter cars that were creating a sort of waterfall that you can run under from km 20 or so onwards.
* I ran 42.8km. Adapt your pace to the actual distance you expect to run, i.e. marathon plus 600-800m. Include deceleration for water stations and 1-2% or so GPS error.
* Overall, the course feels like a big party, so much cheering, you will enjoy it!

**Course Tips:**

* It's a flat course, yet, know where minor inclines and bridges are to avoid surprises. Also there are turns and roundabouts.
* ”Wilder Eber“ around 28km with a stage on the left and some cheerleaders at the right can be a great place to pick up your pace towards the end. It’s the southern tip and from now onwards you‘re heading north.
* The last bridge before Potsdamer Platz is a tough spot—many runners slowed here, like Takele. It’s less than 4km from here! Pick it up! I might stand here on the left side and cheer you up in 2025 :) 
* At Potsdamer Platz, at the big street crossing, keep your gaze left and look left to spot the Brandenburg Gate—it’s a great mental boost.
* The cheering seems to stop / feels much less from Potsdamer Platz to the Brandenburger Gate area, there’s almost silence, just something to expect.
* The finish is about 400m after the Brandenburg Gate—give it your all once you see the gate after the very last left turn onto Unter den Linden! This is it! You did it!!

**Post-Race:**

* The finish area was — compared to the start — well-organized, you just walk through get your poncho and water and so on, with an easy meeting point (A-Z signs). Also, there are Erdinger (alc free beer) hangout areas and a large lawn by the Reichstag where you can meet people. The exit is where the entrance was, i.e. opposite the Reichstag. Again U5 Bundestag is the closest stop. 
* Some public transport stops feature neither escalators nor elevators. Walk up sideways or backwards.
* Fucking celebrate :)"

### Training
30F, This was my 3rd marathon in the last year, each one I followed Pfitz 18/55 pretty closely, some slight modifications to accommodate for work travel, generally just moving runs around within the week. It went very well, only missed one long run in February when I got COVID, but thankfully I bounced back quickly and was only down for about 3 days. A couple niggles popped up here and there, but nothing more than some pain post-run that was gone/tolerable the next day. This block I added a little mileage to have 7 total weeks at 55 miles. I really like this plan and I think it’s served me well, next time I might change it up to Hanson’s just to try something new and potentially a bit more challenging. I’ve been chasing 3:20 for each of my last marathons, and I’ve felt it’s been attainable each time based on my training and half marathon times, but bad luck and tough courses meant I haven’t hit it yet. Although I want a BQ with a buffer, I tried not to put too much pressure on the race and remember to have fun. Running in Tracktown and finishing on Hayward is a bucket list experience, so even if I didn’t hit my goal time I wanted to enjoy the race.

### Pre-race
I actually tried to carb-load properly this time. Aimed for 550-600g/day starting Thursday. I made it 2 days and just couldn’t stand how funky my stomach felt, so I decided to eat normally the day before and just snack on gummy candy to avoid potential race day disaster. I do think this helped a good bit and I’ll probably try this strategy in future. 

We flew into Eugene from NC Friday evening, got to our Airbnb, grabbed some late-night pizza, and headed to bed. Saturday did a morning 3 mile shakeout around campus, walked to packet pickup, spent some time at the 5th Street Public Market and the Duck Store. We ended up walking maybe 6-8 miles which wasn’t the smartest, but I do a lot of walking in my regular life so my legs didn’t feel too fatigued. Early pasta dinner and went to bed.

### Race
Thankfully the time change was in our favor, so a 7am start felt like 10am. Woke up at 4:45am no issue and ate my usual pre-race PopTarts and LiquidIV. Had plenty of time to panic over what to wear because 45, while perfect, is such a hard temp to dress for in my opinion. I had planned to just do spandex shorts and sports bra, but I worried about being too cold at the start, but long sleeves was definitely going to be too warm and I didn’t pack any throwaway clothes. I ended up going with short sleeves and it felt just about perfect. Walked over to the start around 6:30am, took a gel with 10 mins to go, got in our corral, and at 7:02am corral B was off!

Miles 0-13:
My race plan was not to go faster than 7:35 pace in the first half, then check in and try to pick it up if I felt good. I had a friend pacing me which made the experience so fun and I liked not having to rely on the 3:20 pace group, where I tend to get overwhelmed running in crowded groups. Clearly I didn’t stick to this plan, but I felt very controlled and was able to talk most of the first half. Took gels at miles 4 and 8, delayed my 3rd to mile 13 because I started feeling full, which tends to happen to me in races. I also took a salt tab every-other gel. I’m a heavy, salty sweater, and I’ve learned from past race disasters I have to supplement salt. We hit halfway about a minute ahead of pace, and I felt good and told my friend let’s hang here until 20 and see what I have left for the final 10k push.

Miles 14-20:
I started getting a little antsy here, as shown by this being the fastest section of the race. We really had to try and hold back, as there’s still a lot of race left.  I’m still learning how MP is supposed to feel in a race. You’ve run 13+ miles, so obviously you’ll feel like it, but you still have a long way to go. I kept thinking “if I stopped right now, it would feel like I just finished a training long run” and I think that’s a decent metric for me at this point in the race. Took a gel and my next salt tab at mile 17. Not a lot else to report here, the greenway section of this race is long and boring (but pretty!), with below average crowd support. Having a friend with me made the sparse crowds not really matter, but had I been alone I think this might have really affected me.

Mile 20-26.2:
I was still feeling good, but starting to notice my right calf and left hamstring a little. My pacer told me we’re safely on pace for 3:18, so I decided let’s just hang on and don’t try anything that will lead to an epic blow up. Mile 23 is where it started to feel hard, and my pace slipped a little bit. There was a short but kind of steep downhill under an overpass, and I felt both legs wanting to cramp, said a quick prayer that my legs can hold on. By mile 24 I so badly wanted to be off the greenway, just for a change of scenery. Mile 25 I got a glimpse of Hayward, and heard my friend say I might be under 3:18. I felt like I was hanging on for dear life, just begging to see the 26 mile marker right before you get to the track. Finally I was on the home stretch to Hayward, turned right into the stadium and tried my best to soak in that epic finish. Staring down the clock, smiling the whole way, I saw 3:19, so minus 2 minutes from gun time meant 3:17 was in sight. I heard a spectator cheer “CONGRATS ON YOUR BQ” and I crossed the line at 3:17:46. High-fived my amazing pacer, collected my medal, and made my way out of the stadium.

### Post-race
We found a clear spot in the corner by the med tent, and laid down for a good 20 minutes. My fiancé also ran the full, and another friend the half, so they finished long before we did. Walked up to the concourse, grabbed a chocolate milk, realized we probably weren’t going to locate the rest of our group in the crowds (we didn’t have our phones), so we decided to meet at the Airbnb. Spent the afternoon brewery hopping in Eugene, and ended the day with a huge ice cream at Prince Pückler’s for dinner. 

It was a weekend where the stars aligned and everything went right, and I’m so glad I decided to push my comfort zone and book my first “destination” race. Highly, highly recommend Eugene to anyone considering it. Such a well organized race, and a finish on Hayward Field really can’t be beat. Looking forward to a little break from marathon training after a year and a half of back to back blocks. I have a December half marathon on the calendar, and that’s about it until hopefully Boston 2026!

# Training

Training was near flawless. I was consistent. I hit fast workouts with plenty of MP running. In the early summer, I ran a 4:40 mile....in August, I ran a 1:19 half on a hilly and humid course. Multiple 20-22 milers, including plenty with MP miles of up to 17. I averaged 55-60 mpw, peaking around 72 miles. I feel I was set up for MP as low as 6:15!

# Pre-race

I felt fantastic coming into the race. Nerves were low as I had decided that even with a potential MP of 6:15, I just wanted to break 3. If everything went according to plan, I knew I could hit 1:27 at the half and still go < 2:50. If not, I had plenty of room to run a 2:55.

# Race

The first 5k was exactly what I drew up. I wanted to be 21 - 23 minutes and I hit just over 21. Same story for the half - goal was 1:26 - 1:28 and I came in just under 1:27. Most importantly, this felt 'easy' and I was ready to keep rolling! Nutrition was on point and consistent with training...a gel every 3 miles, a hand held bottle with Skratch nutrition for electrolytes and some added carbs that I would refill as needed along the course with water. 

As I passed mile 16, I started to notice some tightness in my calves. I ran slightly different to keep working through and keep them from progressing to full fledged cramps, and this worked for awhile. Unfortunately around mile 22, this started to become a major issue. I ultimately 'froze' up in the middle of the road, unable to unlock the cramp. I had to walk long stretches from that point forward, but I was not going to DNF this. 

# Post-race

I'm left here trying to figure out how and why I cramped liked I did. 

Could it be the shoes? I don't typically run in carbon shoes, and experienced no cramping like this in my 20- 22 milers (that included fast running in warmer conditions) during all my training!

Could it be the crowds? I tried not to weave much - I knew patience was the better call here as I could always pick up the paces later on. But, there was still some weaving as I was navigating such a large race.

I'll continue to explore this one...and guess I need to sign up for another...

I just ran the KDF half marathon on Saturday, so I thought I'd come back and share my results based on the training I did leading in.

My last open HM I did back in 2021 where I went 1:40:xx (I know, so close to sub 1:40). I mainly compete in triathlons, so I just didn't have room in my year since then to fit one in. I would say my running since then was relatively stagnant.

Leading into the race I completed the 2x3 mile session with 2 minutes walking rest between intervals. I did have a rest day before the session, but was otherwise under normal training load for that week. I averaged 7:20/mile for the first interval, and 7:24/mile in the 2nd. I was holding a solid 7:20 through the first 2 miles, but faded towards the end due to leg fatigue. HR was relatively consistent comfortably in zone 3. I was feeling confident about hitting a PR on race day.

**The Race**

The taper went really well and I was feeling pretty fresh going into the race. Temps were in the low 50s. Couldn't have asked for better conditions. When the race started I focused on maintaining my effort based on feel, and didn't want to tie to pace too much. Watched the heart rate to make sure I wasn't lying to myself, and ended up settling into 7:16/mile through the first 4 miles. I knew this pace was probably too hot to hold through the entire race, but I really wanted to make sure I got everything out of myself and din't mind having to fade a bit in the back half to know I didn't leave too much out there.

I felt like I made a smart move and eased off the pace for the next 5 miles. Anybody that has run this course knows as it is nearly flat the whole way you do run and then up to go under a few bridges, and then down and up again to go into the infield of Churchill Downs. These were my slowest few miles of the course where I dropped to more like 7:25/mile, but I felt good that I was holding a consistent effort.

This takes me into the final 5k of the race. We're at the business end, I'm running at what feels like a dead sprint, but my legs can't move any faster. I'm holding right at 7:20/mile and gritting it out to get to the finish. I was able to zone in on someone about 100 meters infront of me and reel them in over a mile or so. As soon as I pass they get right on my heels for the last mile. This was a blessing because it gave me a reason to push at the end and not let up. Give them credit that they broke past me with about 1/4 mile to go. Gave them a fist bump after the race.

Came across the line in 1:36:30, a 4 minute PR. Average pace 7:22/mile. Incredibly pleased with the effort, and couldn't have asked for anything better.

**Conclusion**

I guess race predictor workouts can be right sometimes. Ended up averaging right in-between the splits of my predictor session. Did I go out a bit hot? Maybe, but I would've rather lost 30 seconds over the whole race than feel like I ran it too conservatively. I feel like I was able to get everything out of myself on the day.

Congrats to anyone else who toed the line on Saturday."

# Background

As mentioned in previous race reports I've made: I was a D1 Rower in college and had only ran casually for cross-training. In May of 2021, a shoulder injury prematurely ended my rowing career, so I decided to focus more on running and aimed for a goal of running a Boston Qualifier at the Philadelphia Marathon. Two weeks before the marathon, my right lung spontaneously collapsed and put me in the hospital for two weeks. After months of recovery, I began ramping up my training to try again at Philly in 2022 where I ran a 2:47:45 ([Race Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/z10fh5/philadelphia_marathon_collapsed_lung_redemption/)). After battling on-and-off injuries for a year and missing the registration for the Boston Marathon due to work travel, I decided to give it another shot at the Delaware Running Festival Marathon in April 2024 where I ran 2:35:32 using Pfitz 18/70 and finished 2nd Overall ([Race Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1cbj6nq/delaware_marathon_running_festival_a_podium_finish/)). I was injured and sick for 4-6 weeks out of the 18-week plan which is where this 13-minute PR shocked me the most. Backtrack to the Fall of 2023, I had found out that my time qualifier from Philadelphia (2:48) was still valid when applying for a guaranteed entry into the Chicago Marathon 2024... which ended in my first ever bonk ([Race Report](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1g72yfp/race_report_chicago_marathon_2024_a_failed_yet/)) due to poor fueling and panic about losing my phone in Grant Park. Anyways, this past year, I made it an effort to make sure I didn't miss the registration period for Boston. Using my qualifying time from Delaware (2:35:32), I finally got the notification that I've been accepted! Now that I was in, and I knew that Pfitz 18/70 wasn't enough to get faster. Therefore, I decided to up my...

# Training

Since I knew Pfitz plans were effective, I decided to up the mileage and train with Pfitz's 18/85 while also increasing my intake of nutrition on long runs. I tried using my lessons learned from injuries and illnesses to take my easy days EASY and my hard days HARD and focusing more on getting my daily nutrition right. Well, even with this mentality and execution, I still found myself with some serious Posterior Tibial Tendonitis by the middle of Week 3, and I didn't know it at the time... due to work travel. Therefore, I decided to be cautious and use an Arc Trainer (2 Miles Running = 15 Minutes Arc Trainer) or Spin Bike (1 Mile Running = 3 Miles Cycling) for the Pfitz trainings until I got a clear diagnosis. After a few of my doctor's and PT appointments when I got home, it was recommended to me to strengthen my legs with home exercises and cross-training before hitting the road again. Therefore, I decided to adjust my Pfitz plan to the 12/85 plan, and for a while, it was smooth sailing. I was hitting new Long Run paces that felt easy, and for 4-5 weeks, I was averaging about 82 miles a week without feeling absurdly fatigued.

Well, as soon as I hit the beginning of my 3-week taper, I felt a dull, achy pain in my right upper thigh. I tried doing some stretching and PT exercises, but it didn't feel like I was hitting the pain. I only felt the pain when I was offloading weight off that leg, or when I had it on the edge of a hard surface. The pain did manage to subside once I began my run, but it would immediately come back once the run was complete. Once again, I was ironically on work travel when this all occurred. After some frantic medical searches with ""Dr. Google"", I found a bunch of threads saying that these were signs of a Femoral Stress Fracture. As I was scared and didn't want to make a bone injury potentially worse, I stopped running completely for 11 days. I tried to stay off it as much as I can when I was working, and I got an X-Ray at a local Urgent Care which gave no indication of a stress fracture. As soon as I flew home, I booked an appointment with my orthopedic sports doctor, who after reviewing my X-Ray and assessed my injury, told me they didn't believe it was a stress fracture and that they believed it was an adductor strain. They then said I was safe to race the marathon. Therefore, on the last week before the marathon, which took my Pfitz 12/85 to 10/85, I got back into running which still felt off in terms of injury and HR, pace, and effort. This last week leading up to the marathon was full of anxiety and mentally draining, which leads us into the...

# Pre-Race

**Thursday:** I do an easy 6 miles in the morning before work, which felt okay-ish, work a half-a-day, and then meet my parents at the airport to fly a short flight to Logan where we meet my brother. We all then get into the rental car and drive 40 minutes to my Aunt and Uncle's house in the suburbs.

**Friday:** I get in a 5-mile, light run with strides at ""Marathon feel"" in the afternoon. The run, again, felt off which was a bit annoying, but the pain didn't get worse with the strides. However, I managed to occupy myself mentally with my extended family, who was just happy to see me, and me, my cousin, and my brother go out to a restaurant that has board games.

**Saturday:** My uncle's a chiropractor, so when I told him about my leg issues, he encouraged me to come into his office to work with my leg. While his efforts initially did help, I went out for my final, recovery 4-mile run later in the day. My leg started acting up, and at this point, I'm at a complete loss of what to do. At the end of my run, I just start punching my leg out of frustration. I walked back into the house, feeling defeated, where my partner, who had taken a red-eye from the West Coast the night before, was awake to greet me. I immediately forgot all about the run and spent the evening with her and my extended family as my immediate family travelled back to Boston to check into their hotel room that was near the finish line.

**Sunday:** My partner and I said our goodbyes to my extended family, and we take an Uber to Beacon Hill to my old friend's (Let's call him MO) apartment. He had initially heard I was running Boston and literally offered his own bed to me and my partner even though he was running the marathon, too. My partner and I then walk over to the Expo and meet up with my brother, and we pick-up my Bib and explore the different stands in the convention center. Afterwards, my partner and I took the T back to MO's place where we met up with another old friend, JB, at his place in Cambridge for a friends-Easter dinner. We all got together along with some more friends, two including long-time friends ME and JT, and had a few laughs and a delicious carbo-load (while also over-hydrating). Throughout the dinner though, I still had the thoughts of my leg in the back of my mind. When we got back to MO's, I was foam rolling and stretching which didn't provide any support. I'm immediately feeling dread until MO decided to put on the first Rocky movie. Watching an underdog with little chances to ""go the distance"" really did inspire me a bit, and it was enough for me to stop worrying for the night, put my nerves at ease, and, for once, get a good night's rest the night before the race.

**RACE DAY:** I wake up at 5:00 AM and use multiple strips of K-Tape to tape my thigh. I put on my old college rowing racing singlet and Janji Half Tights. I learned from Chicago that the cross-country shorts pockets were the reason my phone fell out of my pocket, so I decided to invest in some nice Half Tights that could hold my phone tightly and many Gu's in my pockets during the race. I then put on my throwaway shirt and my Vaporfly 3's (since MO's place was 0.5 miles to the bus pickup station at Boston Commons). I eat a bagel with peanut butter and water with Liquid IV for breakfast. I turn on my Shokz OpenRuns and do a light jog to Boston Commons while listening to ""[Philadelphia Morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siOlyuB4ToQ)"" from the Rocky soundtrack, in spirit of the movie inspiration from the night before, to keep me calm, and arrive by 6:30 AM. At this time, there were very few people waiting around the bus pickups as I was in Wave 1 Corral 1, so I decided to listen to some Lo-Fi music and just chill in the park. Once boarded and en route to Hopkinton, the mixture of thinking about the pain I was feeling in my leg while walking in the line to the bus, the fact that it took me so long to get to where I was presently at, and the potential of not running this race overwhelmed me as tears rolled down my face for the next 45 minutes on the bus. Once we got dropped off, I made my way over to the baseball fields of the high school, sat in the sun, and ate my snacks that were in my start line bag. I start doing a dynamic warmup, which instigates my leg pain, and at this point I think in my head: ""Okay that's it. I'm done.""

As I begin to walk over to the Medical Tent to get evaluated, my partner calls me. She asks ""Hey, how you feeling?"" This is where I unload all my built up emotions that I wasn't sure if I can do this, and that if I do, I'm afraid of making my leg injury worse if its bone-stress related. That's when she says to me:

""You've come so far to making it here. Even if you have to pull-out of the race because the pain gets worse, we'll all be proud of you no matter what.""

... and that's exactly what I needed to hear. I knew then and there that I was going to run till I collapse. The goal wasn't to PR. The goal was to finish, or get as close to the finish as I could, and make sure I have fun while doing it.

As I made the walk over to the start line, I chatted with a few people in my Corral, but my real focus was on finishing this race. As I wait by the Town Common, I begin doing a dynamic warm-up, but it was a slightly different warmup then my typical dynamic stretches. I put on ""[Going The Distance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvQkl7qa6RQ)"", which is also on the Rocky soundtrack... and I begin shadow-boxing and shuffling my feet. I have no idea why, I was just overtaken with emotion and dedication that it just kinda happened. The national anthem soon plays, and as the jets pass overhead, all I could think was ""Please let me finish this race; I will do whatever it takes.""

*""RUNNERS! TAKE YOUR MARK!""*

I take a Vanilla Bean Gu, queue up my playlist, close my eyes, take one deep breath... and smile.

# Race

*""****BOOM****"" - the starting gun sounds.*

**Start to Mile 7:** I'm prepared for the crowds this time. Chicago was my first ever Major, and I panicked during that start 6 months ago. This time around, however, I knew it was going to be jam-packed crowded, and that these first six miles were downhill, so I stay calm and hold-back while getting into a rhythm. I made sure to nail down my nutrition plan for this race. I would take a gatorade cup about every 10 minutes this race, and I would take a Vanilla Bean Gu with some water every 20 minutes. After Mile 4, I noticed that my leg pain was starting to fade away, which made me think ""Okay, I can manage this"". As I pass through Ashland, it was quite peaceful in a sense: while every resident living in the town turned out and were cheering their heads off, the overall open roads and the occasional... okay well more than occasional as there were a decent chunk of them, gas stations were what kept my mind at peace. I finally hit the town of Framingham, and all of a sudden, I hear a familiar voice...

""*HANG-10!!! YOU'RE KILLING IT!!! GO!!!""* \- it was my old college rowing buddy, CC, jumping up and down with a huge smile on his face! CC and I used to cross-train by running from our college campus in Philadelphia, down Market and Race Streets, over the Ben Franklin Bridge into New Jersey, and back. He's one of my rowing teammates who actually suggested that maybe I should get into long-distance running. I give him an immediate smile, and make my way over to give him a big high-five, like what we used to do after a solid row on the water back in college. That smile of mine was stuck on my face for...

**Miles 7 to 13.1:** While still keeping my foot off the gas pedal, I was expecting a minor hill here, which I overcame without any issues. The people of Natick were giving their entire hearts out to support the runners during this time period as we climb. This hill led to another downhill where I made sure to focus on holding back. At the bottom of this hill, I come across the halfway point at 13.1 where I look at my time for the first time this race: 01:14:29... a feasible sub-2:30 split. I immediately start having doubts: ""Am I going out too fast? Will I absolutely be defeated by Heartbreak Hill? Is my leg going to blow up at any moment?"". Well those doubts, along with the music from Shokz, were immediately drowned out by the SCREAMING of the Wellesley students partaking in the ""Scream Tunnel."" It felt like [Beatlemania](https://youtu.be/M6DfG7sml-Q?t=14); I didn't know this was a tradition until after the fact, but seeing this support immediately made me snap out of it and continue to just enjoy the race while I can.

**Miles 13.1 to 16:** The sun is really starting to pack some heat. I start taking more waters and gatorades, as per my nutrition plan, at their respective Aid stations to make sure I don't dehydrate and/or have my muscles cramp/seize up. However, this sun isn't stopping me from continue to hammer down splits sub-5:40 min/mile. I did get a little bit worried and say ""[Woah, just take it easy man!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZC3JJ3tAKk)"" out loud when I read my watch write ""5:28 min/mile"" at the end of Mile 16, (FYSA: My half marathon PR is an average of a 5:25 min/mile). That's when I realized where I was at...

**Miles 16 to 20:** The Newton Hills. Throughout this stretch of up-and-downs, I began having doubts of if I could maintain the pace I was holding. That's when the Boston College students started showing their loud and unwavering support. At one point, I even heard a ""Holy shit look at that Drexel guy sending it!"". Like with the Scream Tunnel, I just focused on taking it all in and enjoying the crowd as I navigated what felt like the Himalayas. For a little bit at Mile 20, it felt flat for once... a bit TOO flat... we all know why.

**Miles 20 to 21:** Heartbreak Hill. This was it. This was what all the r/AdvancedRunning race reports warned about. As soon as I start to see where it begins to incline, I took one deep breath, and said out loud... ""Hang-10. Fucking. Send. It.""

In that moment, that's when I noticed the crowd started getting louder, and I climbed that hill like I was a Bull while, un-ironically, listening to [Bulls on Parade by Rage Against the Machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=my6bfA14vMQ). I just kept thinking ""just make it to the top of the hill, even if your leg gives out, just make it to the top""... and you want to know what I thought once I summited Heartbreak Hill? ""Oh shit... I still have more in the tank!""

**Miles 21 to 25:** It's just all downhill from here. The classic ""[Gonna Fly Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioE_O7Lm0I4)"" from Rocky starts playing, and I just begin to churn and burn. I start to notice the mile splits start to come down: 5:26 min/mile, 5:35 min/mile, 5:33 min/mile, 5:33 min/mile. These splits were still hard, but they were manageable. Mentally, it helped seeing both ME and JT at around Mile 24.5, and the fact my brother was sending me texts cheering me on. However, as I entered into Mile 25, I saw another steep bump, and my headphones had died.

**Miles 25 to 25.9:** ""[Annnndddd its gone!](https://youtu.be/-DT7bX-B1Mg?t=27)"" I feel the engine start to die. My split starts to creep up towards the 5:50 min/mile mark. I just kept thinking to myself ""Hang-10, you're almost there. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other. You can finish this. You can finish..."" That's when I turn onto Boyleston Street.

**Miles 25.91 to 26.2:** ""...finish... ho-ly. shit."" The street is PACKED and the crowds are screaming. For context, I work in industrial/construction environments where noises are loud enough to cause hearing damage. The crowd was LOUDER than that. I'm so overwhelmed until I hear, above all the cheers, a ""LET'S GO HANG-10!!!!""

It's my partner. Even in a crowd that could cause tinnitus, her voice still punched through to me. With her, I see my entire family and extended family cheering me on. I just smile, with pain in my face, and give them the ""Rock-On"" signal with my hand. I bolt with what felt like cement blocks strapped to my feet, but I'm still moving. I'm so close... just a couple more steps to the...

**FINISH LINE:** ""YES!!!!"" I screamed as I cross the finish line.

# Post-Race

I begin the long walk out of the exit chute, where my dull, achy leg pain reappears, but none of that mattered now. I was Boston Strong. *I FINISHED THE BOSTON MARATHON.* I then receive my first ever Boston Marathon Medal. As the volunteers put this medal around my neck, I can't help but feel a tears coming out of my eyes. I wiped the tears, grabbed some snacks, and then reality hit... I was pretty loopy from the heat of the sun, and my leg pain was starting to flare up. At this point, I decide to check my phone to keep my mind straight and off the pain. I check all of the messages I missed, including from a groupchat with friends where one of my friends sent a screenshot of my finish time: ***2:28:22.***

I start laughing hysterically, as I ""loved"" all the messages from all my friends congratulating me on my 7+ minute PR. JB even texted in that groupchat saying ""Dude, I was at the finish and you were cooking!""

I finally make my way over to the family meeting area where my partner, who was wearing a ""Hang-10"" shirt with a bunch of pictures of my face on it, and my family gave me a group hug.

# What's Next?

It's been a week since the marathon, and my leg pain hasn't gotten worse since before the marathon. It still hurts don't get me wrong, but I have a PT appointment scheduled for next week and a Sports Doctor appointment scheduled in a couple weeks. I've just been resting and relaxing this past week with absolutely no training. I'm thinking I'll try indoor cycling and some upper body lifts at the gym this upcoming week along with my old PT exercises to strengthen my glutes and hips on my affected leg.

In the medium-term, I plan on running the Berlin Marathon in September later this year, assuming I (hopefully) stay injury-free. I would like (key word: LIKE) to go sub-2:28, so I can say I time-qualified for the Tokyo Marathon as a semi-elite.

In the long-term, It was recommended to me via my last race report that if I went sub-2:30 to look for a coach to possibly get me fast enough to run an Olympic Trial Qualifier. For context, I've been completely self-trained, without a coach or a team, the past 4 years of my running career.

At the end of the day though, PR's are great, but they aren't the most important aspect of this sport to me. They come and go. What a PR represents is the time, journey, memories, and support that it took to get to that point of a PR.

It took me 4 years, a collapsed lung, multiple injuries, illnesses, and forgetfulness due to work travel, to finally make it to the Boston Marathon, and I have now finally done it. This race, throughout all 26.2 miles was a representation and an accumulation of all the support I have gained from the people I care about over the past 4 years. To say that I fell in love with this race is an understatement; this race was something beautiful that I am still trying to understand.

# Conclusion and Thank You

Thank you all for reading this post if you've made it this far. I know it was long, but it is everything I thought, felt, and personally experienced throughout the 26.2 miles of this course. As always, I have a ton of fun writing these posts and including funny little memes and references, so I hope you all enjoyed it in the same way.

**Training**

I'm a masters runner who had a bit of a breakthrough on my 29th (I think?) marathon in 2019 at Chicago. Ran a 2:43 at that race, and I thought that maybe if I really went for it, I could break into the sub 2:40 territory. Started my training in earnest, and of course, Covid broke out in 2020, so races were tough to come by. Ended up running a small marathon in September 2020 on a hilly, windy course and ran a 2:40:07 or something like that. Just missed it. Ran a time trial a month later and ran 2:39, but of course, without a bib, it wasn't all that satisfying. In May I ran a sub 1:10 20K and started marathon training in early June. Mostly base stuff, and as the summer moved along, started adding threshold work and closed September with lots of MP. Weekly mileage was in the 85-90 range, with usually two weeks up, one week down (55-60 miles on down weeks). My goal, prior to seeing the weather, was sub 2:35, but when the forecast started to lock in, modified my goal to sub 2:38/2:39. Sub 2:40 at all costs was my C goal. A little more background: my first marathon was 15 years ago, and I ran a 4:06.

&#x200B;

**Pre-race**

Got to Chi on Friday afternoon/early evening, got settled in, went to the expo, all that fun stuff. Saturday was a 20 minute shake out and relaxing. Not thinking about the weather, not stressing about the race. Drank a lot of pedialyte. Forgot pins for my bib and had to run out Saturday night for those, which was pretty stressful!

&#x200B;

**Race**

I was lucky enough to gain an entry to the American Development corral, so I made it down there at about 6am. Put my feet up, drank some water and all that. Felt like a bit of an imposter in the AmDev tent, especially as a masters runner, but tremendously thankful not to have to stand in line for bathrooms and be able to sit down. Just before we line up in the corral, I down gel #1.

&#x200B;

**Miles 1-8:**  Steady, keeping an eye on the heart rate. I could definitely feel that it was warm. Wind was at my back, and I wasn't exactly comfortable, but the pace felt OK. I've noticed the faster that I've gotten, the less comfortable the first half of the race feels. I miss the days of the first half of a marathon feeling easy! Gel#2 goes down the hatch at #6.

&#x200B;

**Miles 9-16:**  Some negative thoughts creeping in as I go along. We've turned into the wind, and I'm shocked that people are drafting off me. I'm not a big person, but I look over my shoulder every now and then, and there are a few people running directly behind me. This is the point of the race where I start to blank out a little. It's tough, I'm trying to keep my HR near 165, grabbing water and gatorade every aid station. Gel #2 at mile 12.I have to take a random gel because my last gel broke open in the starting corral.

&#x200B;

**Miles 17-22:**  Oh my god, this is getting tough. Had a real moment at mile 18 where I thought I might walk, but just shut that thought down and kept going. I'm passing people pretty steadily now, and some of the blue-bibbed elite women are coming into focus. It was really make or break at this moment, but every mile that went by made sub 2:40 more real. Don't think, just run.

&#x200B;

**Miles 23-24:**   I tell myself I need to pass 25 more people for the rest of the race. I think I got to 25-30 by mile 25, but my counting abilities are slipping a little. I do know this: once I got to 23, I knew I was gonna do it, and my legs instantly felt better.

&#x200B;

**Miles 25-26.2:**  Drop the hammer, I start picking it up, grabbing the last few people, and encouraging others to come along. Take the last right turn, up the bridge, then a hard left towards the finish. I f'n did it. 2:37 and change, sub 2:40 as a masters runner, 4th pr in a row, and about 30 seconds from an even split. People were falling off left and right those last 10 miles, but I hung on, thanks in large part to training volume and MP work this summer.

&#x200B;

**Post-race**

Grabbed a medal, foil blanket, and a beer. In a fantastic mood and ready to enjoy the moment. Made the long walk back the AmDev tent, chatted up a few people, and just fired up. Met my wife and best friend, and we took off. I have been so happy since I crossed that finish line. The sub 2:40 dragon has been slayed. I feel like I'm playing with house money now, and I'm looking forward to just racing and having fun. I ended up being 95th for men, 112 overall, and 5th in my AG. Thinking back on how far I've come, it's just unreal to me. I wouldn't recognize myself back when I was running 3:00 marathons, much less my first race at 4:06. I feel so thankful to have the ability and privilege to train and run. Chicago has been too good to me the last two times I've been there!"

### Training
Background: M35. 1.5 years ago I weighed 280 pounds, and decided to make a major lifestyle change. I started taking GLP1 meds and working out twice a week with a trainer. Got hooked on the gym and started working out 4-5x a week. 1 year ago (March 2024) I ran my first mile, and from that moment on distance running became my new love. Did my first 5k in May 2024, hit 100 pounds lost in August and switched to weight maintenance mode at my new weight of 180lbs, ran my first 10k in September 2024, and then a 10-miler in late October, after which I kicked off training for this half marathon.

My training plan was 19 weeks long, and based on my performance at the 10-miler (1:25:xx) I set a half goal of sub-1:50. My training plan was: Monday (intervals/hills), Tuesday (gym), Wednesday (easy), Thursday (long run), Friday-Sunday (2 easy runs + 1 rest day). Mileage started at 20mpw and peaked at 35mpw.

November was focused on 5k speed- lots of shorter interval workouts (12x400m, 6x800m, etc), and long runs were 8 miles. In early December I set a 5k PR of 23:32. Throughout December I kept working away with longer intervals (e.g. 4x1mi) and long runs of 8-10 miles. I set a 10k PR of 49:40 at the Polar Opposite Peachtree on January 4th (brutal course, btw).

After that it was all focused on the half. I did a few more 10 mile long runs, and kept working at the 1mi intervals, but then it all went to shit on my first 12 mile long run. It was probably a top 3 run for me - I was in NYC for pleasure, and I ran along the water from the west side, down around Battery Park, and up the east side, and back. Beautiful scenery and hit my paces well. But at the end my knee was sore, although the soreness went away after a few hours. The next day I went on a 2 mile run with a friend and the knee was killing me.

The 4 weeks between that run and the race were terrible - my weekly mileage plummeted from 30mpw down to 12mpw, and I would typically get knee pain after about 2 miles of running. My longest run was 7 miles, and in the last week I mostly rested with two 4-mile walk/run sessions.

Going into the race, I had no idea what would happen - would I make it? How much fitness had I lost? And how would the lack of long runs late in the block affect my ability to finish out? My new goals were A) finish, and B) go sub-2 if the knee held up.

### Pre-race
Picking up my bib at the expo on Friday was super easy. On Sunday morning I got up at 5am, had a protein bar, a Red Bull, and 2 Tylenols, showered, and got in the car. It was about 32 degrees and very windy, so I changed in my car and headed to the start line as late as I could. I ate another protein bar and had a second Red Bull, and a bottle of water.

As I made my way to wave A, I was delighted to be stopped by some volunteers who were making a path for the pros to get to the start line for the USATF Half Marathon Championships. It was pretty exciting to get to see folks like Clayton Young and Dakota Popehn getting ready to run the same course I was about to run. I walked to the front of wave A to watch them warmup and start the race, and then I made my way back to the middle of wave A for my own start.

Popped a third Tylenol two minutes before the start and got ready to go!

### Race
And we’re off! I was emotional at the start - I wasn’t sure if I’d even make it to the start of this race, so being here and having just watched the pros haul ass had me pumped up!

The first 4 miles were a bit of a blur since I wasn’t familiar with that part of town, and I was pretty focused on how my knee was feeling. The pain started at mile 2, but mercifully it never got above a 4 or 5 out of 10, so I focused on trying to keep my form consistent, and I took four 30-second walk breaks throughout the race to give my knees a bit of time to rest along the way.

Miles 4-8 were my favorite, because we went through some pretty neighborhoods that I’ve spent time in (Inman Park, Little 5 Points, Virginia Highlands). I really found my groove once I spotted my favorite sign that I decided to make my mantra (“Pain is temporary, Strava is forever”). I took some Gu’s caffeine chews at mile 4 and again at mile 8, and alternated between water and Powerade at the aid stations.

At mile 8 I saw my other favorite sign of the day (“I bet this seemed like a great idea 3 months ago”), and had to start to get gritty. My aerobic fitness felt solid, but the muscle fatigue was real - I was definitely feeling the lack of 12-14 mile long runs that I had programmed in late in the training block.

As I pushed through mile 11 I got a notification on my Garmin from my wife that she had managed to get our toddlers dropped off at my parents place and had made it to see me finish, which gave me all the strength I needed to push through. At the point where the full marathoners split off from the halfers, I thanked my lucky stars I wasn’t signed up for the full 26.2.

Turned the corner, saw the finish, and kicked up the sprint for the last 100 meters!

### Post-race
What a feeling! Finishing my first half marathon, getting to see my wife at the end, all of it was super emotional. I didn’t have too much time to feel the emotions because the next thing that called all of my attention was the knee, which hurt BAD once I stopped running. Got home and was walking around like an old man all day. Two days later I’m feeling a lot better, but still feeling the knee, so I’m thankful I had already booked PT starting tomorrow.

The goal from here is to get the knee healthy, find a sustainable 20mpw running schedule and just be casual for the summer, probably with some laid back 5ks along the way, and then consider getting back into training for another half this fall.

There’s so much good advice on here from gear, pacing, fuelling, hydration. It’s been an amazing resource so thanks everyone for your help.

I did the Paris marathon in 3:11:20 last weekend and I’m over the moon. I started with ambitious goal of 3:30, put in 6 months training before starting a 17 week plan. I ran 5x a week, did strength work, carb loaded, you name it. Felt like a coiled spring race day so decided I’d aim to 3:15 as I ran a 1:30 half in my build up. On the day the adrenaline and taper pushed me 4mins below target. 

I’ve entered Amsterdam this October so will have a look at Pftiz 18/55 and see how close to 3 I can get. Any tips for an inter-training block, training block are welcome.

Thanks again, you guys are great."

### TLDR;
Nursing mom of 3 signs up for a marathon <2 weeks out, BQs and PRs by over 10 minutes. Big mileage year following loads of PT and nearly needing surgical repairs from delivery of final kid. Running is awesome. Not every race is a PR, but this one worked out.

### Background
36F, mom of three (5/3/barely 1), youngest still nursing. I don't often see race reports here from parents still in the trenches, especially the nursing parent, so I thought I'd add my voice. I'll add more detail to this section in particular in the off chance it helps anyone in a similar position.

I didn't do any sort of organized sports while I was growing up, but running long distance was always in the back of my mind because I grew up seeing my dad train for Twin Cities and Grandma's Marathon with my aunt and uncle. I had planned to run Twin Cities in 2013 but didn't after a stress fracture a few weeks into training. I ended up running a half in 2016 (2:21:XX) using a basic training plan, but didn't run much or at all before or after it, then ran a full in 2017 (4:52:XX) using a Higdon plan. I made time for every prescribed training run, but never developed a love for it or any sort of consistency. The fastest mile of my life was still an 8:05 in middle school, and running was only ever about aesthetics, not athleticism or truly enjoying the act of running.

Fast forward a few years. After having our second child in 2021, I took up running in mid-September of that year for some me time, and fell in love with it. I figured out what you all reading this already know- running is pretty damn great. From spending time outside, seeing leaves fall as seasons change, discovering the way movement can help you process what you need to, and both getting lost in your thoughts and being okay being alone in your thoughts- running is awesome.

That winter, I built enough of a base to sign up for TCM '22 and follow Hansons Advanced, adding miles to peak at 72mpw. I qualified for Boston with just under a 5 minute buffer, but didn't sign up (nor would have made the cutoff for 2024 anyway, to clarify) since I was expecting our third and final child in mid/late September 2023.

After delivery + the recovery period, I had my few postpartum runs and immediately knew something was wrong. It wasn't the typical ""I am not in shape, so the first few weeks of running feel like running in a pool that's also somehow magically uphill,"" but rather the ""I need a pelvic floor PT yesterday"" situation. I was diagnosed with POP (pelvic organ prolapse), specifically bladder prolapse and rectocele. Running was uncomfortable and felt as if I had a sandpaper tampon in. My PT said I could run, that feeling is the one-two punch of hormonal shifts from nursing + prolapse, vs ""you are injuring yourself."" Unfortunately, the morning after a 4 mile, slow, flat run a few months into PT, I felt like someone had taken a baseball bat to my nether regions. Good times. A referral to a uri-gynecologist later, and I had an rx for estradiol and a more intense PT plan moving forward. I was not a good candidate for a pessary, but depending on how I responded to my rx, I was looking at two very different next steps: pelvic floor tissue that is now healthy enough to support my lifestyle, or a complete hysterectomy with sacrocolpopexy and pelvic sling, which is not always successful, plus months of recovery. I was one of the lucky ones who got to go with option A.

Off to the races. LFG.

### Training
After being cleared by my team in January to run as normal, I built base mileage that month before adding speedwork in February. May-August were over 300 miles apiece, and hitting paces in workouts I'd not been able to prior. I kept sprinkling in 18-21 milers because they are fun, a great chance to get out of my own head, and take time for myself. I peaked at 90 miles across 7 days twice (first as a birthday gift to myself), but was mainly 6 days on/1 day completely off. Within those 6 days, I had 1 LR, 1 medium-long progression, and 1 interval OR hill workout; 3 days were easy. I did a lot of treadmill running so I could nurse the baby when needed. I continued my PT regimen from home. As with when I started running consistently in fall 2021, run lengths would often be dictated by when the baby needed to nurse. As she got older and feedings spaced out, my runs could stretch out. All of this was and is only possible because my husband and I are each other's greatest supporters in our pursuits. He is an avid cyclist (and has also run a number of marathons), so we ensure we both have time to chase our passions. We include our kids in them as much as possible, whether it's Burley miles or races with a kid race attached.

September rolled around, and I saw a post online giving away 10 entries to TCM. I half smiled while entering, since I'd told myself I wasn't doing a full until our baby was sleep trained; she was a ""nurse off and on all night"" kid. Go figure, 36 hours after she slept through the night for the first time, I got a message notifying me I won one of the ten entries. Excited and semi-panicking, I signed up for TCM just under 2 weeks out. I compared the last few weeks of my 2022 build to the last few months, so I knew I had the miles and speedwork under my belt to pull off a PR, BQ, and potentially best my dad's PR from Grandma's back in the 90s, if I ran a smart race. I was nervous for both any potential postpartum (PP) bathroom emergencies, and that I was just coming off of tapering for a local 15k a few weeks prior, but if all else failed, the bib was free!

### Pre-race
I followed the carb loading guide from Featherstone to hit over 500g of carbs in the three days leading up to the race, and cut significantly back on fiber 5 days out, and even more 3 days out.

Packet pickup in St. Paul was an absolute blast. I took my three year old son, and let me tell you, between the bowls of candy, free stickers, random prize giveaways of high-value-when-you're-three items (Water bottles! Hats! Pencils! Squishy PT balls!), it was like the best indoor, running-themed party he could have asked for.

 On race day, I was up at 6 after a restless night to eat a graham cracker with PB, go number 2 (always a good omen), and nurse our freshly-minted one year old. I had tossed and turned all night because I was anxious, but I do that every race. Maybe when I have more of them under my belt, I can get my heart rate down the night before. Ah, well. Room for improvement.

My husband and I managed childcare for the morning before heading to drop me off a few blocks away from the start line. He dashed off to St. Paul to park, then bike back to cheer me on, duck call in hand, so I'd know where to look.

I took two Cliff blocks while walking to the portapotties and got in line to pee, which ended up taking over 20 minutes. I had never been more relieved to smell other people's poop wafting towards me as when I finally got close enough to the head of the line to smell it. As a result of the wait, I got to talk to a runner around 30 years older than me, with kids around my age. This chat ended up being one of the best parts of the entire day, if not the single best part. He explained that he was a lifelong runner, and his four kids all flew in to run TCM with him. He had run it many times prior and race day was very much about enjoying time as a family. He said that while he was still raising his kids, being out the door early and back in time for breakfast together was the norm. His four kids ""even all get along now!"" he boasted, in addition to loving being active and outside. He was just so kind, humble, encouraging, and one of those ""this is the running community at its best"" folks. The relationship with his kids, shared love of being outdoors, and willingness/vulnerability to chase goals is 100% what we strive for in our house, and the exact boost I needed pre-race. Before heading our separate ways, I congratulated him on his massive accomplishment, telling him he is absolutely living out my life goal.

Oh, shit. That's the national anthem. Time to get to my corral.

### Race
**Miles 1-8**

I got to corral A and quickly realized there was no way I'd make it to the general vicinity of the 3:20 pacer. I didn't plan to run with the pack, but figured that would at least help me avoid being hemmed in by folks in the 4 hour group. With no space or time to get through, I opted to stay put. Not making enough time to get there without being a jerk was my fault, and I wasn't about to act like it was anyone else's. The gun goes off, and as the wheelers began, I sipped more water, discarded the bottle, and cleared my head. The feeling was different from two years ago - from ""holy hell, I am going to attempt a BQ"" and ""why am I doing this to myself?"" to ""what is my best performance on this day?""

The gun went off for our group, but it was a walk/shuffle to the start. I was not prepared for that, nor for being elbowed and shouldered while getting out of the bottleneck of downtown Minneapolis. I shed my throwaway layer and started my watch just as I crossed the mat.

*""Okay. We are really crowded here. My goal average pace is maybe out the window right *now*, but let's keep this first part under 8s, and see if we can get it back at the end. No need to waste energy trying to weave in and out of the few gaps that exist.""*

I had mentally broken up the race and the first part was ""get out of downtown,"" and eventually, we had. Next up were the lakes. We used to live not too far from Harriet, so it felt like seeing an old friend when we got to the area where I fell in love with running three years prior and had done so much of my training for my first TCM. Around mile 3, things started opening up quite a bit, and I felt like I could determine my own pace rather than the pack I was crammed in by.

*""Gotta keep it moving. Wait, a bottomless mimosa table? And people running mid-7s and low-8s are grabbing them? No, thanks, I'm good.""*

Watch beeped, mile 4, time for two more cliff blocks and some water. The next four went by quickly, and I took two more blocks at mile 8. I was opting to fuel more than my last race (this race: every 30-35, last time, every 40-45).

**Miles 9-17**

Mentally, I knew I needed to get my head in the game. I had my watch (a forerunner 230 that's still kickin') set to show current pace / average pace / distance, and it was really messing with my confidence that my average pace was still no where near my A or B goals. I told myself to just stay the course - I'd done a 6:55 for a race that was longer than where I was at, and with warmer weather, so any pace issues were coming from a lack of mental fortitude, not fitness.

*""HOOOONK, HONK, HONK, HONK, HOOOOOOONK"" ""LET'S GOOOO YOU'RE KICKING ASS BABE.""*

Hey! I know that guy! 

I closed my eyes briefly, ""blew out the candles"" as we tell our 3 year old when he needs to re-center, and locked into a 7:31 - 7:37 for the next 9 miles. Physically, I was fine. breathing was in control, water and fuel were going down no issue, and I hit a few water stops along the route despite having 40 ounces in an ancient 4 bottle Nathan waist pack that they don't even make anymore (shoutout to my husband for letting me have it a few years ago!). At one point, I could feel some impending cramping in my right quad, and added two Salt Stick tabs to the mix around 12 and 16.5, whereas I'd had them at 10 and 16 two years back. I noticed that cramping feeling here and there for the rest of the race, but it thankfully didn't turn into anything that created problems for me. My splits make it look like mentally this was where I really locked in as well, but the entire time, I was struggling. ""Just get to 13.1 and reassess"" ""Just get to 15."" ""Just get to 18.""

**Miles 18-19**

The slight downhill on this chunk of the course aligned with the slight downturn of my confidence to break 3:20. I was really concerned with both my average pace, and what I was going to feel during the final 10k- especially the last 5k. Was I going to bonk? Would it be mental, or physical? Why did I sign up for this?

It was around 10am, so I was also just becoming physically aware of the fact that my youngest is usually nursing at this time. Anyone who has a nursing partner or has been that person knows that it can be uncomfortable and eventually downright painful if you need to nurse, and can't. At a year + a few weeks postpartum, it was not in the realm of painful yet, but I do want to make mention of it to draw awareness of what is a very real logistical and physical challenge for endurance athletes who are nursing.

When I heard more honking, it was with immense gratitude. I needed the boost. Supportive partners kick ass. Time for me to get my head screwed on straight and kick some ass, too.

**Miles 20-23**

*""Okay, Summit hills. I remember these! But I don't live in Minneapolis anymore, and my short-ish runs still get a few hundred feet of elevation even when I try to go the flattest route. Shoot, even my 3 mile shakeout clocked just under 100 and that's after driving to a flatter area. We can do this. 5 year old's words of wisdom came into play here: You can do this. You're a badass. Go 45-6"" (our family term for doing your best/fastest. She came up with it while biking with my husband on his shotgun pro/ridealong seat when she was around 2 or 2.5).""*

When I ran TCM two years back, my slowest miles were here- 8:05, 8:20, 8:21. This time around, I wasn't going to let myself dip into the 8s on the hills. Push, push, push. Pass a few folks.

""Go peaches!""

""Looking strong, peaches!!""

Who the hell is peaches?

Oh- *I'm peaches.* I'm wearing obnoxious BOA shorts so my husband could more easily spot me. Well, go me! Now where is the end of this climb again? 23? 24? Wait a second, is that Tim Walz??? Hell yeah!

I was starting to realize I had more gas in the tank than I'd realized. I knew once I crested the hill, I'd need to punch it to make it under 3:20, and knew I had it in me. I heard a familiar ""Hooooooonk! HONK HONK hooooonk!"" and yelled to my husband that I'd toss him my belt at 23.

**Miles 24-26.2 (and change)**

Tossed the belt, time to leave it all on the course if I could. Two years back, I finished with gas in the tank, and I wanted to push it earlier here and see how much I could empty it. Belt gone, literally lighter, and I stopped looking at my watch while cranking up the pace with whatever I had left. I thought about my husband's advice from the last marathon- about picking the next target to pass down the road, passing, and then choosing the next one. My watch chirped, I didn't bother looking. Keep the foot on the gas, and we might just squeeze in past our goal. Saw a water station at 25, and thought, how fast? How fast can you push this last mile and change? 

25 to the finish also coincides with a really well-deserved slight downhill. I saw the huge flag, the capital looming, and hauled it. I crossed the finish, walked to get my medal, and  realized I'd not stopped my watch. Beep. Save. Guess we're waiting until the results load online to see if we made the goal.

### Post-race

I used my space blanket as a modified sack of sorts to grab snacks to bring home to the kids, a promise I'd made the night before. Banana, chocolate milk, said hi to my cousin who'd come out to see the finish. No duck calls yet but I knew my husband was close by. I went back for chocolate milk number two, and during that refresh, saw I'd met my A Goal and quite literally screamed with joy, startling the chocolate milk volunteers, and prompting them to ask me if I was okay. Yes. I am absolutely okay. Met up with my husband, took a photo together, and yet again forgot to get a picture on the capital steps. We headed out to grab the kids, nurse the baby, and do what parents do the rest of race day- read books, play Barbies, pretend to be Darth Vader, change a diaper, wipe someone else's butt, and pack a lunch box.

Up next- Grandma's this June, either TCM or Chicago next fall, and hopefully Boston in 2026 (LORD that race is expensive).

### Background
38 M. I believe I have a unique story and want to share for those who are approaching this sport from an unconventional angle.  
August of 2024 I felt like I was giving too much of my life to alcohol so I made a plan to just give up all alcohol for two weeks. The boredom set in and I started running again. I loved running in my teens and early twenties but never did it competitively (no teams in  my small school) but I had not run recreationally in over a decade when I decided to put on the shoes again. Although I did find ways to be active at work and through activities like hiking and hunting.  
During this two-week window I finally listened to David Goggins' Can't Hurt Me (I know, I know but hear me out) and he talked about meeting someone that morning who was giving him excuses as to why he couldn't sign up for an ultra until he felt ready. Goggins' advice was to just sign up and do it. Basically, if you wait until you feel ready, you'll never get there.  
I immediately found a half marathon 12 weeks out and signed up. Registrations for Pittsburgh opened shortly after that and I signed up for this one too.


### Training
This was a roller coaster. At the time I signed up for this race it was still 7 or 8 months away and I was confident that was plenty of time to at least be in a position to finish. In the meantime I was focused on the half in November.  
Of course, my body wasn't used to running and I developed tendonitis in my peroneal tendon early on. It was a huge blow at the time. Thankfully my workplace has it's own wellness center and there is a PT on-site. The ""injury"" turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The PT is also a runner and had a ton of exercises to show me. It was also a great chance to get comfortable being in a gym and I added strength training twice a week, minimum.  
If there is one thing I can't stress enough, especially to new runners, you absolutely need to get into the gym. Strength training is a non-negotiable in this sport. For us older guys, weighted calf raises are an Achilles saver. I do these several times a week to failure with heavy weight (nearing 400 lbs at this point).  
The setbacks meant that my longest run going into the half was only 5 miles but I was feeling good so I decided to race it. It was the right call. I had a great time and was pretty pleased with myself to go sub-2 at 1:58.  
At this point I'm starting to develop a new obsession with the sport of running and I'm planning to stretch out into ultras later in 2025. Unfortunately my sister-in-law, who does absolutely no exercise, tells my wife in December that she's going to do an ultramarathon in March. That's 4 months away. The little competitive demon inside of me finally found it's inspiration.  
So I signed up for the 100K too.  
Once again, another blessing in disguise. After trying to add speed work I developed Achilles tendonitis and checked back in with the PT. We get to a point where I can train (only missing the first week) but I eliminated any real speed work going forward. So over four months I spent about 90-95% of my training in zone 2. At the start my Z2 pace was 10 min/mile but I worked it down to the low 8's. I wouldn't realize it until later but this caused my aerobic base to inflate like crazy.  
My longest run in training was a marathon distance that took me 5 hours to finish. For the most part I built up to 40+ MPW in peak and concentrated on a few back-to-back long runs that would give me 50K in a weekend.  
The ultra was Blackbeard's Revenge in the Outer Banks of North Carolina. It's a flat, road race. It took me 16 hours but I finished, which was the only goal. My sister-in-law was a DNS.  
The most important lesson I learned is how much pain I am willing to withstand to achieve my goals. It's a lot.  
Within three days I am running again. My workplace's wellness center also has a dietician and she helped me dial in my nutrition leading up to the ultra. I saw an incredible improvement in my recovery. It's almost astonishing how big of a deal nutrition is.  
A week later I PR my 5K (21:30) after getting obsessed with Strava segments and attacking a 4-mile segment. I start running hills and adding tempo runs and strides to a majority of my training over the next few weeks. On my long run two weeks before Pittsburgh I add marathon pacing and I'm feeling confident that I can do this.  
On my easy runs I'm throwing 500-900 feet of elevation gain and a similar number to my descents as well. It's easy to find hills where I live so I make sure I run them. I also practice letting the hills pull me down when running downhill. When you do it right you can run faster and easier and your HR will come down. This skill will unknowingly be very important for Pittsburgh.  
My Garmin predicts I can run a marathon in 3:20 so I readjust from a goal of sub-4 to sub-3:30.  
One week to go and I race a local trail 30K. I can't help myself so I race it, and win! Elevation was 2400 ft.  
Finally, it's race week.  


### Pre-race
I don't get much sleep. A nap is a better way to put it. I always have an 800 calorie smoothie before I run (gut training ftw) so I have that an hour before we leave. We set out for Pittsburgh with an arrival time of 40 minutes before the start. Of course an unexpected road closure at the last minute throws us through a loop. There goes my parking plan. I hop out of the car at a red light, my wife jumps into the driver seat, and I grab my shoes, bib and gels. I'm on a sidewalk with no shoes on and all my stuff for the race. It's stressful but it works out and I make it to a port-a-potty and the start line with a few minutes to spare. I eat a Honey Stinger Waffle and get in the zone.

### Race
I get placed in Corral B, which is the second wave of the race. They split B into two groups so I'm out of the gate 15 minutes after the gun. I believe they separated based on projected finish times. It means I have a lot of people to pass, which is a slight boost, honestly.  
With the hill training leading up to the race I honestly don't even notice the climbs except for the big one at the halfway point. What I do notice is the downhills and I am just flying down those. My mile 5 split is so fast because of this reason.  
I use downhills, port-a-potties and water stations as quick breaks on my route. Each brings my heart rate down. I walk through several of the fluid stations. All splits above 8 were bathroom breaks. I could've gone less but I was making great time and didn't feel the need to force myself to be anymore uncomfortable than the race was already making me feel. I might be in a good position to deal with pain but it's the little things that keep you mentally checked-in.  
There was no wall for me. The only notable thing was realizing that I was getting bored around mile 18. Otherwise it felt better to move than it did to stop. I also didn't struggle with the humidity although I would've liked some of the rain they were calling for.  
I used 6 gels and took a bag of gummy worms and Sour Patch Kids from spectators on Carson St, which I also used as fuel. I don't usually trust spectators giving out food on the course but I took a chance with this one and was glad I did since I left my gummy clusters in the car.  


### Post-race
Crossing the finish line was very undramatic. I knew what I wanted to do and I knew I was going to do it after a few miles into the race. It might have been more exciting had I started with the first Corral and had people who could keep up, but oh well. I immediately start putting solid food into my stomach and we make our way home after a quick pit stop at Trader Joe's to get a little more post-race fuel. I don't even know what I ate, I fell asleep after we got back in the car and an hour later I moved to the couch in our living room.  
My legs were very stiff as soon as I finished but by that evening I started to loosen up again. I've been on a few easy runs, logging 21 miles so far this week. I'll stick to easy for awhile. I have two 50K's on the calendar for the rest of the year and then I'm going back to Blackbeard to tackle the 100-miler next March.  
I really enjoy the marathon, though. It's a great test of endurance. I have goals of getting a BQ after this first one and I don't think that's super unreasonable. It's just a matter of finding the right time to properly train and be in the best marathon shape I absolutely can be.  
Main takeaways, there is more than one path you can take in this sport, and there are benefits to be gained by putting your body through different distances. You can do hard things. You'll surprise yourself when you decide to commit.  
If you ask little from your body it will give you little. If you ask a lot from your body it will give you a lot.  
Anyway if you made it this far, thanks for reading and I hope you crush your goals.  

Also, I'm still sober since last August.

How?,"Apologies if this is a common question (I tried to search it up)— it seems like a lot of the “how can I improve my time” questions come from the sub 5 hour folks wanting to become sub 4 or sub 3 folks. I’m wondering if anyone has significantly improved their time from 6+?

I’m trying to see my training in terms of multiple years instead of months— so, trying to plan out training for a spring marathon the next two years and also have training blocks to improve on my shorter race times (my 5k is 34 minutes, 10k is over an hour, half is 2:30, etc) so I can also improve my marathon time… but it’s hard to figure out timing and balance (and also what do you do between blocks? Do you just go into the next block?)…

I’m two weeks out from my last marathon (barely sub 6) and my training block went really well— but my hr still spikes when I try to run faster than a 12 min/mile (normally my half pace) and I actually almost passed out/was super sick for an hour after a cold/wet 8 miles yesterday… I tried very hard to cross train and run very little for two weeks but I’m losing my mind and my cardio fitness at this point… I have a half as a fun run in January (family thing) and my next A race is a full in early May, plenty of time to train, but I want to try to figure out how to train smarter after that and add in some shorter length race training blocks for speed.

Hoping someone started slow and has done the long view vibe (or maybe I’m in uncharted territory/should have been born faster if I wanted to run the marathon…?)

Edit: thanks for your support and ideas guys!  I made an 18 month plan that includes:

my current strength-recovery/morphing into mini speed block (adding more hills/strides/ vo2 max to my speed work, which is currently mostly tempo runs) 

the next 18/55 marathon training block, which will continue strength/speed and ramp up miles for my spring marathon attempt;

a summer 5k training block from faster road racing that maintains ~18/55 mileage but focuses on even more speed (and hills, my mortal frenemy)

a half marathon training block for the half our family runs every single January (which focuses on increasing mileage further, with the faster road racing half 2 plan)

then finally the 55-70/18 in spring 2026, when maybe (JUST MAYBE) I will break 5 😭

I will report back and let you know how it pans out"

Let me explain.

Race Information

* **Name:** Media Maraton Villa Carlos Paz * **Date:** MARCH 16, 2025 * **Distance:** Half Marathon * **Location:** Cordoba - Argentina. *** Shoe for the race: New Balance SC Elite V4 (first race using carbon plated shoes)

About me: started running in 2021, at 41 YO, now I am 45 YO, running 4 times a week and going to the gym the other three days.

Goals

I was aiming at around 1:46:00 time, with a pace around 5:00 per KM.

Training

Subscribed to Runna for this one. Been hearing  a lot of good things about the app, and since, because of my schedule, I train alone and very early in the morning (I run 4 times a week and 3 days I lift at the gym), the app helped my with structuring my plan, between easy runs and speed sessions and it pushed me hard! It was a challenge for sure, but it was a lot of fun and made me feel stronger than ever as training progressed. It was a 12 week training plan.

The Unexpected

As I've said, training was going awesome and the hype for the race was at peak level. This is a race that I wasn't able to run last year because I was dealing with peroneal problems that had me off running for almost 6 months.

Thing is, ten days before the race, while at the gym, I decided to not to a hard leg session that day because I wanted to start deloading the legs to be well rested for the race. Stupidly I decided to make 3 series of jump box excercise. At the last rep of the last series, I stumbled while jumping, and bang my tibia with the box HARD! It instantly swelled and blood was coming out! I thought it was the bang, so I went home and put ice on it. The thing is the bang left a scar (it was a hard hit) and that scar, once it healed, would stop more blood from coming out of the injury, so two days before, the area was incredibly swollen and it made a hematoma. I have a friend who is a doctor, and he gave me a corticosteroid injection to see if it would get better but nothing, so the decision was made to make a cut into the wound to take the coagulated blood out of there. That was last tuesday, so 5 days before the race. When I got out, and for the next three days I was having a hard time even trying to walk, so I saw myself almost 100% out of the race. I was borderline depressed after all the training I went trough.

Since the race is around 50 km away from where I live, we reserved to have a four day holiday with the family, so we had to go anyway. You can imagine my mood. Having to come and having planned the holiday around the race. But the foot started to get better on saturday, I mean, the wound was giving me a lot of pain since it hasn't healed properly yet, but i was able to walk with little pain, so I asked my friend if I could run. He said to me to try runnning 3 o 4 km the day before and see how it responded. The fear was that I get a hematoma again. Went ofr it and had no pain while running.

The day of the race was key to see how I woke uo, and if there was no blood or the area was swollen I had a green light. Woke up that day and, MIRACULOUSLY it was ok. The happiness I had was hard to explain. I was able to at least try to run the race, which two days before it was impossible for me to even think of being able to run.

Pre-race

Woke up at 5:00. Cured the wound, and prepared for the race. Breakfast was at 5:30, and i had a coffee with two toast with some butter on them. Drank half a Gatorade before leaving and had a nougat 20 minutes before the start.

Race

In training, the targeted pace was 5:00 per km (8 minutes and 3 per mile), but since I wasn't able to run  at all last week, and taking into account that i had no idea how my leg was going to respond at the race, the fact that I was there at the start just made me soooo happy!

Weather was great, it wasn't cold but neither hot. Started the race and gradually tried to get the pace that I've trained for, and was feeling great! No pain whatsoever. So i was able to mantain it and even get a little faster on the second half. Course had some hills on it, so it's not an easy route, but I was feeling great and couldn't stop thinking about how lucky I was to even be there running. Last meters I had a terrible cramp on my left leg, but I endured and finished strong with a time of 1:43:31 according to my watch. Official time could be a little less.

Nutrition wise I had two caffeinated gels, one 6 km in, and the other 12 km in, I had a third one ready but decided to skip and instead ate a banana that was given to me at around 15k.

Running is a privilege, and I always feel that way, but never more clear after the incredible journey leading up to this race!

Post-race

Family was waiting at the finish line (wife and two kids, 8 and 4), and I saw them twice during the course, so it was very emotional. I cried like a baby once I crossed the finish line and even more when I saw them after finishing.

So this was and unbelievable race for me, taught me a lesson to be even more grateful to being able to do this at this age, and the privilege I have of being healthy. And also, so proud of me that even with all the setbacks of the injury, I never in my mind gave up, and was able to endure it all and be there at the start.

Thank you for reading, this ended up being a long race report and sorry for the grammar, I am from Argentina so english is not my first language!

KEEP RUNNING!!!!!

Sunday I got to run the Verdun Marathon. I'm not a super active poster, but I have enjoyed reading your insights and have learned a lot from hearing about your experiences. In that same spirit, here is my race report.

**Result:** 3:03:20 (chip).

**Goals:**

* PR - check!
* 2026 BQ - check! (although I got a bit nervous seeing the news of the changed cutoff)
* Sub 3:00 - nope!

**History:** I'm 44, soon to be 45, and this was marathon #5 for me.

* 2012 - 3:38:XX - Hal Higdon Intermediate 1
* 2013 - 4:00:XX -  Throw in some long runs and hope training plan
* 2019 - 4:02:XX -  Running 30 miles a week, no training plan
* 2023 - 3:29:XX - Pfitzinger 12/55

**Training:** I used the Hansons Advanced plan, which I absolutely loved. My initial goal was 3:15, which felt plenty ambitious. Around week 8, I started to notice the target paces getting easier and easier, even as the workouts were getting harder or longer. I started gradually upping my goal and paces, first to 3:10, and eventually to 3:00, which I knew things would have to land perfectly to hit.

**Shoes:** Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3

**Race:** The weather was warmer than I was hoping for (18 degrees Celsius to start, 24 at the finish). The course was scenic, taking runners on four loops through Verdun's waterfront park on the St. Lawrence River. I was a bit worried I'd be bored, but the course made it easy for my wife and kids to cheer, which was a big help. I think I saw them 7-8 times.

The first three loops/20 miles of the race felt great. I was right on pace for the sub-3 and found a new friend to work with for the first half. He ended up dropping out around the half-marathon mark, and I was on my own for the last 13 miles, which wasn't ideal. I definitely bonked a bit in the last 6 miles, and by mile 22, I knew that my sub-3 goal was no longer possible. With no one closely chasing me, and no one in sight to chase, I let my foot off the gas a little bit and just enjoyed those final miles, feeling grateful for the experience and the support I had along the way.

**Challenges:** The warmer-than-expected weather was a bit of a challenge, but nutrition was the bigger hurdle. I gagged and vomited my first gu (fortunately just the gu and hydration, not all of breakfast). I practiced this a fair amount in training and got much better at this, but didn't practice with gels that were warmed against my body in my spandex pockets. This changed the temperature and consistency, and caught my overactive gag reflex off guard. I only got 4 of the planned 6 gels down, and this probably hurt me a fair bit in the last 10k.

**Finish:** Crossing the finish line was an incredible feeling. I felt much stronger than I have at any previous marathon. I didn't realize it as I was finishing, but I took 2nd/125 overall and 1st place in my age group. Getting to be on the podium was a fun benefit of running a smaller race than the Montreal Marathon, which is coming up next week.

### Training

Coming out of last year in Richmond where I ran 3:14:24, I knew I had to do more. The last six miles of that race took me out of a sub-3:10 attempt. I felt I needed to put a lot more miles in to a) go faster and b) help prepare my body for those later miles better. I have a coach I have worked with for a while now and I trust his process. Felt he made some adjustments this year to help me understand my goal pace better and how to control it. Knew my body was ready for a big jump, just had to make some adjustments to how I trained for this attempt.

This easily ended up being my strongest training block I have had (this being my sixth marathon). My previous weekly high was 56 miles and this year alone I had 4 weeks that surpassed that, peaking at 60 in early October. That also was part of a three week stretch where I went 60-56-58. Each of August, September, and October surpassed 200 miles with a high mark of 233 in October (also a new personal high). My track workouts were always on point. Lots of interval training with a few hill circuits and tempo runs mixed in. The long runs were excellent too. My best was a 17 mile run in mid-October where I did 3x4miles at MP, HMP, Faster. This really gave me the confidence that the speed for a sub-3:05 was in me. Never had any injuries or even the inkling of an injury, fueled well and felt I was very disciplined in ensuring I was keeping my body ready and healthy all year even at the higher mileage.

I mixed in some benchmark races as well. There was an early 5k on July 4 (a hot day on a hard course) that I did in 19:16. Over a minute faster than I did the year before on the same course. The other key race was a 10k in September (warmer, rolling course) where I ran a tremendous race. Perfect splits on the way to a new 10K pr of 39:17. And the last was in ""tempo"" style on the track by myself where I ran a 5k in 18:41, the fastest I have ran a 5k since high school. All in all, my performances were telling me I was ready to go big in Richmond and probably in the best shape of my life so far. 

The last key piece of information that will be relevant soon, I also switched to the Nike AlphaFlys as my race shoe. Over the build, I ran in them three total times. A 3k on the track, a 10 mile tempo run, and a six mile ""simulation"" run the week before the race. They felt great each time and I was really excited to have them with me on race day with full confidence.

This is my hometown race too, but I was in Portland, Oregon for a few days before the race only returning late on Thursday night. Was a bit worried about how this could affect me with the time change and sleep, but luckily I was able to grab some rest on the plane and took steps to ensure the travel didn't mess with my legs. Lots of moments spent standing up and stretching out a bit.

### Pre-race

Set the alarm for 4:30, had two fried eggs and a piece of toast. Had mixed together some electrolytes to sip on early. Had some bowel movements (grateful for this. Too often over training I seemed to have a mid run bathroom break). And slowly got dressed and prepped my gear. As it was my hometown race, and I am ultra conveniently located between miles 18-19, I was able to have my family bring me some gels later on so I didn't have to carry so much. I had mapped out eight gel stops; 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23. And I would get some extra fluids from them too. Was at the starting area by 6:05 to get ready for the gun at 7.



### Race

Started right in front of the 3:25 pace group, knowing I would go a smidge faster than them for the first mile. Perfectly run first two miles as I settled into my race pace. The first few miles are sneakily uphill, so wanted to keep it around 7:10 early which I did to perfection. First water stop was a near nightmare. Took my gu, but as I get ready to go for a water the runner in front of me stops on a dime and I have to dodge them or I would have crashed into them. I was very lucky that I was able to reach out with my finger and grab the very last cup on the table as I ran by. Minor crisis averted. The first time to steal back some time is mile 7. You really drop of the table here and so I opened up a bit, was comfortably able to dial it back once we bottomed out the hill. The next two miles are flat and was able to settle into it here. I started to notice around 8 miles that I felt things were really coming together. I knew from last year's race data that my HR was above 170 for nearly every mile. At mile 8, I noticed that I hadn't had a single mile where the average was above 170 yet. Really helped me feel comfortable with the pace, even though a couple miles were a few seconds above my goal pace. The next few miles are tough, especially with the sun out. Right in my eyes and low in the sky. Made smart decisions at 10 and 12 to ease up the hill knowing there was chances to get some time back at 13-15. My heart rate was starting to tick up a tad, into the low 170s but I still felt super loose and comfortable.

And here we approach what I consider the most important part of the course. Miles 16-18 are where we cross a long, uphill, and exposed bridge. It can be breezy, and it was a bit today. I hoped to be able to draft a bit up here to ease my way across before the final stretches. Couldn't quite get that as it was just me and a smaller woman in front of me. Each of these miles are uphill and has been the source of multiple heartbreaking moments for me. However, this being my fourth attempt in Richmond I finally felt I had put together a successful plan for navigating this stretch. My dad met me at the top with all my fuel and I was able to open it up again. Having the extra gu and fluids were so needed, especially with the sun. Wouldn't have done what I did without it.

He left me with just over 10k to go and I knew it was all in my head now. My heart rate was rising, nearly 180 bpm at 20 miles. And my big toes were starting to get mad at me. I had run in the Saucony Endorphin Pros before (I also train in Saucony shoes) and was used to some pain from the plates so I felt it was probably that and just told myself to grind through it. The next few miles tick by, it's flat and fast here. Lots of crowd support and I know this stretch like the back of my hand. I had run the final 10k numerous times over training. I wanted to know every single turn and bump in the road. My body was screaming at me with 3 miles to go. I never knew this pain in my life or the other five marathons I had done. I had entered the Pain Cave. I really felt like I didn't see or hear anything from here on. My body wanted to shut down. My toes were even more painful than the rest of my body at times. But even that pain washed away. Each mile was more painful than the last. But I knew this was my day. Gave every ounce of myself for those last few miles before flying in with a new 8.5 min PR!! The greatest race of my life so far and proud to finally have worked the mental side to overcome the pain cave in that way.

### Post-race

So much excitement and relief. Had a great time at the finisher party having some pizza and beer. Hung out for a bit before making my way home. Like I said about those toes? It was here that I finally took the time to remove my socks. The toes had been sore afterwards, but nothing like they were in the middle of the race. And yet they were (and still are!) about as blue as could be. Rest in peace preemptively to my nails. Still tender today, but not as painful. I had suffered through some legit pain and not just carbon fiber plates, so that was a bit of a relief. Clearly, my shoes were probably a half-size too small. I had run in size 8 shoes for probably a decade now. Unfortunate that it happened, but I don't think I could have known. Each of those runs I had used them for were pain free. But the marathon finds all issues and makes them worse, so here I am with some gnarly big toe nails today. Taking it easy with them, they seem to be getting better and not worse so that's good. Grateful for this performance and hopeful to take another step to the BQ standard next year."

# Training

A little hodge-podge here. I wanted a new approach. I have had several races gone wrong with obscure training philosophies. So it was a lot of reading and learning to tailor my body to my goals and learn what works for me instead of following a paid plan. Don't get me wrong, I still purchased a plan and followed a couple as sheer guidelines and learned what made my body feel good. I had one thing in mind while training: the race is the celebration, the training is reason we celebrate.

Overall, I adopted the Hansons Methodology as this is where my body, mind, and soul kept drifting back to. I felt great whenever I followed their process. Tired as all hell, but this adventure has brought me to the most fun I have had while training. Cannot thank them enough for their ideology and explanations of how and why to train.

The taper was weird, as with most new training plans. But for the first time, I was able to trust the process and succeed.

Final thought while training: I did a year and a half of IM's prior to 2025 and I was sooooo fed up with the endless subscriptions and paying for this and paying for that. I really wanted to pay to learn vs paying a service to get me across the finish line. I really buy into the idea to train to adapt vs train to survive. Thats why we do these crazy things!

# Pre-race

Week before my 4yo gave me a nasty full cough that thankfully with A LOT of Zicam and rest I was able to dry up and finally get some good rest the night before. Not ideal, and I was ready to accept the consequences of my race. I still woke up with a great nights rest (finally) and continued with my pre-race setup. Macros the week leading up were upped to about 60:25:15 (C:P:F). Morning of I did my usual peanut butter and banana sandwich while sipping on my LMNT Chocolate and Coffee. Drank about 10oz of water and 6oz of Gatorade up until race start. 15mins prior I ate my final snack: 1/2 portion of Starburst for something chewy before sucking on gels and water for 3+hrs.

# Race

Setup my Garmin PacePro plan against elevation as a new tactic. Not exactly negative split, but overall a good strategy to conquer some hills.

Miles 1-10 were a breeze. I banked arguably a little too much time against my Garmin. But I knew in the later part of the race I was going to have 5+ miles with a north wind and an extended elevation gain.

Miles 11-20 was time to settle in. Enjoy the time and knew that the race really started at mile 20. I was sucking on gels about every 4miles and realized through here that I need to up that to every 3miles or every 5k in the future. Energy was dropping at the end of every 4miles.

THE FINAL 10K I was dropping in energy big time. Switched to taking my final 2 gels at 19 and 22 with a Maurten 100 plus caffeine for the final push. LIVE. SAVER. Also, thank you to the 3:15 pacer who finally caught up with me and gave me some final words of encouragement to maintain where I was at.

This was essentially my first race where I was going for a rough and fast PR and only had been taking the race as it was in the past. My PR before this was 3:44:xx and this was a HUGE stepping stone.

# Post-race

I thanked that 3:15 pacer again. Cannot say that enough. I rang that PR bell with gusto and proceeded to enjoy the post-race festivities sporting my shiny new medal and a beer in hand.

My goals going forward are to recover for 4wks. Get back into another fabulous and devoted Hansons plan. I have another 26.2 in September where I would love to push sub 3:10 or 3:05. Still unsure whether I will go after that or take it as a half in stride with going after a BQ in January at Disney 2026.

Thank you all for reading!

### Training
I went with Pfitz 18/55 for my training, I'd used the HM plan with great success last year to PB in dreadful weather so I had faith in myself that I could get a good time if I stuck to the plan. I chose the 55 mile one as my work doesn't really allow for doubles and I spent the winter getting back into strength training/cycling so I wanted to keep up some commitment while building on the running.


The first negative about an 18 week training plan and this marathon was that week 1 started on 23rd December, so the first week was a struggle with all the family commitments but we made it work.


I would say I stuck to the plan mostly but had to move sessions around since I take part in a series of trail races over the winter months so on the week's where I had one I would move the LT runs to the Saturday and see how I felt on the Sunday. And with the tune up races later on, I just used my local parkrun as I was either busy working on that day or there were no races of that distance nearby for me to compete in apart from the final tune up race which was a 10k. Although I didn't get any PBs on the tune up races I was only 4 seconds off my 5k PB and 6 seconds off my 10k PB during these tune ups.


I missed 2 runs of the plan due to illness but otherwise I got all the runs done. I know some people dislike the medium long mid week runs and while they are time consuming I think hitting 11/12/14 miles mid week definitely helped with my endurance in this marathon. With the vO²max stuff later on in the plan and the strides I think definitely helped with my last 600m kick in the race. 


If anyone was thinking about doing a Pfitz plan I would definitely recommend it although I think your base mileage going into it should definitely be a bit higher than he recommends as it does ramp up quickly 


### Pre-race
I live in Belfast, so I took from the Thursday before the race off work so I could fly out earlier and get settled. Luckily I have family that live in the Greater Manchester area so we could stay with them instead of getting a hotel. On the Friday morning we went out for the day so on the Saturday we could spend the day relaxing. On the Saturday morning we went to Worsley Woods parkrun which was lovely and scenic and did a gentle shakeout (Pfitz says 4 miles but I wasn't that bothered at this point) and then we spent the rest of the day spending time with family then for the dinner I made what I've had for the last 18 weeks, Pasta, sauce, and chicken.


The morning of the race, I got up nice and early and had my 2 bagels with jam and a banana and then we started to make our way to the start area. I was with 2 other people running but I was in the Blue wave so I was the first starter. We got the tram to the start area and it was quite well organised with the bag drop to one side, which I didn't do because I'd of had to have been there even earlier, and then the start area which quite a few portaloos and a urinal area so the men don't clog up the portaloos.


We got ushered into our special start access bit at about 8:30 which we then had to walk 5 minutes towards our holding pen. The negative about this is after the 5 minute was to the holding pen was there were no toilets after this point and we didn't start until 9.20 so we had 50 mins of no toilet so a lot of people started to go into the bushes.


### Race
My plan for the race was to stay with the 3:15 pacers for until the Altrincham hills then try and push on in the second half. There were 4 3:15 pacers, 2 at the front then 2 behind so I positioned myself in the middle. At the big mile boards I started to check my pace band and compare to my watch and I was about 200m up on my GPS so the pace we were going off at was slightly fast but I had hit those paces on my MP runs so I wasn't too concerned about the pace.


The first 5km went by in a breeze, at the first water stop it was quite chaotic but I grabbed a water bottle and took my first gel. I made sure to keep my water bottle until the next water station since it was getting quite warm. 


Up until half way it was rinse and repeat, chuck old bottle, gel, new water and I slowly worked my way up to be with the lead 3:15 pacers as we entered Altrincham. I knew from online that the hills in Altrincham were bad but since I'm from Belfast I was prepared for them as the hill in Belfast marathon is twice as bad! So I was prepared for them. I took it easy up over the hills then as we were leaving Altrincham I slowly left the pacers. From the elevation profile I saw that until the end it was just a slow incline so I knew I couldn't push too hard and at the halfway mark I could definitely feel the heat creeping up.


This is where the original plan went out the window. I knew I had the fitness to push on but it just kept getting warmer and at mile 15 I started seeing people start to pull off to the side with cramp so my goal became to keep going and to slow down a touch to keep myself from overheating. 


There was fantastic support on this stretch of the route with people with garden hoses spraying people and people with extra water out on the course which really helped. They say the race begins at Mile 20 and that's definitely the case today. This is when I started to see people pull out due to the heat and my goal was just to finish the race. I had my heart set on 3:10 but I knew I had enough left in the tank and enough time banked that I could definitely go sub 3:15 so I soldiered on and just tried to focus on the finish.


The last 10k is pretty much a blur but the sun was out in full force and I was just focusing on the road in front of me. As we turned onto the finish straight I heard people around me groaning as it's a 600m finish straight but I willed myself on to pick up the pace and get over that line which I did in a time of 3:13:45 which was a 10:50 personal best


### Post-race
As soon as I crossed the line I was feeling really woozy and I knew I was dehydrated. Some amazing police officers held me up for 60 seconds so I could get my bearing and start drinking my water. The finish funnel was really long and took me about 10 minutes to slowly walk through picking up all the drinks I could. Once I got my medal, t-shirt, drinks and energy bar I headed straight to the Meet & Greet flags to wait on my family coming. I cleaned myself up with baby wipes and got into a pair of crocs since my feet were destroyed and we managed to get a outside table of Caffe Nero while we waited on my other family to finish running. 


I loved the atmosphere of Manchester Marathon and the support of the Altrincham, Timperly, Sale, Stretford and Chorlton were all amazing and having the finish in the city centre this time was definitely more supporter friendly. Although it's advertised as fast and flat there were some hills but nothing I would call ""major"". I was in the city centre until 5pm and it was still lively with supporters and runners which was nice to see. If you want a great marathon and don't get into London then I'd definitely recommend Manchester, apart from a couple minor gripes I would say it was quite well organised and the support was fantastic.


I was slightly disappointed in my time but I'm taking a couple weeks to recover and then in the summer I have some other goals to aim towards, mainly a sub 40min 10km but overall I'm happy with my time and when so many others either had to pull out or didn't get PBs today I'm grateful to of got a 10 minute PB

As I knew that I would be ambitious for my A goal (previous PB was 3:14), I expected that I would probably blow up in the 2nd half in case I do not make it so put a very much realistic goal for B goal.

# Training

I wanted to start the training after the NYC marathon, but an injury that I got slipping on one of my kid toys (after the NYC marathon), made take a 4 weeks off. I started again with some pain in my left thigh but good phyiscal prep and progressive come back made it possible to start after.

I documented most of my training in the following post on reddit already: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon\_Training/comments/1ikmql9/sub\_3\_shape/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1ikmql9/sub_3_shape/)

Actually, after that post, many things went south extra sport. My work started to ask me more stuff as I have a conference to prepare for March as well, and my kid was getting really sick. On top of working on the weekend, I also did not sleep more than 5h on at least 4 times in the last training block.

In retrospective, the cumulativ effect of everything made it that I did not assimilate that last training block. Also, I got midly sick as well during taper and it did not help. I tried to prioritise recovery but at the expense of very low mileage week. My last 3 weeks prior the marathon were:

* 47 km
* 45 km
* 30 km (with travel to Tokyo)

Overall, I still managed to bank 4 long runs longer than 30km and hitting my pace of 4:14 was feeling comfortable, at an HR of 156-157.

# Pre-race

In Tokyo, the feeling was not great but it was not completely off, also in the last 3 days, I started to feel my body getting out of the pit I was. The warm-up before the race, I felt my legs light. I was not feelint top shape but definitely felt that my easy weeks gave my legs a fresh start.

My strategy was to go for the sub3. I was not very confident about it due to the issue at the end of the prep and the weather (expecting 22°C - where I trained between -5 and 4° the whole prep). But I did not want to regret anything.

# Race

Tokyo is very crowded at the start, and I think no one can really explain why people going to 3h30 or 4h goal are trying to get in front of faster runners. Therefore, the first kilometer is just trying to not fall and find a path to not screw up your race.

Starting Kilometer 2, it is fairly crowded but you can find your pace (for me), I started to bank time. I wanted to use the small decline at the start to get some bank time and then try to cruise at 4:13 pace.

However, I did not expect that the small decline completely destroyed my calves. I have other theory on this afterwards, but already at km7, I felt my legs were not fresh anymore and it would be difficult today, legs-wise. After km10, I felt that it would be a difficult race, the downhill stopped so I was more comfortable getting on my pace, but my HR was high, I run my marathon at around 158-159 and it was at 160... I thought it could be a long day.

I pass the HM mark with 1h30 and I thought that I should try to cruise till the end and start to do damage control of the legs. However, the conditions started to get worse (and better for the spectators), it was really hot and it started to play on me.

From km 24 to 35-36, it was almost full sun and 20°, and I saw my pace starting to get harder and harder to maintain. At Km 32, I thought only 1h to go at that pace, and I ran so many time 1h, that it would be OK.

In the end, it was a death run. I managed to no walk and keep pushing till the end but it was really hard and saw many people giving up or walking in the last kilometers. Mentally it has been a real struggle to see that I was OK on the heart rate, I finished at my Zone 2 pace but my muscle gave up in my legs.

I tried to do a last push in the last KM but I got cramped and just managed to slighlty increase my pace. I finished in 3:08:45 and I gave my everything, so fairly happy with the finish.

# Post-race

A posteriori, after discussing with many people and saw the results on Strava, I am very happy with the race.

It was my most difficult race, the last 10km were brutal, and it was a mental game already at km21 when I knew it won't be possible to make it for sub 3.

Very few people reached their target on that race, and I still managed to get 7 mn off my previous PB 4 month ago, while being injured for a month.  
I know people that ran NYC and they did worse at Tokyo than NYC, even with the route supposed to be easier.

I definitely think that traveling to the other side of the world for it does not help and I probably won't do it again, at least, not for getting a PB.

I see that I need to try to increase my mileage with marathon pace in my training even more or try to get even more pre-fatigued before my long runs.  
As a single father, it will be difficult to increase really my mileage but I know what the path is to get to my goal."

**Time:** 3 hours 32 minutes

**Course:** Super flat

**Temperature:** Started cool, but with no clouds felt pretty hot near the end (around 18 degrees). Having come from a UK winter this felt hot!

**Goals | Description | Completed?:**

A | 3:25 | No

B | 3:30 | No

C | Complete it and enjoy it  | Yes



**Splits:**

**Km 1 - 4:** 5:00 to 5:10 mins each

**Km 5 -  33:** 4:54 average (Fastest: 4:48, slowest 4:57 but generally pretty consistent)

**Km 34 to 37:** 5:00 average

**Km 38:** 5:11

**Km 40 - 42:** 5:24, 5:32, 5:33

**Remain 0.66km** at 4:55



**Background:**

33 male, had ran competitive middle distance in my teens to an okay but not amazing standard, before hardly running at all in my twenties. Picked running up again in the past few years, realised I was more comfortable at the speedier stuff so decided to sign up for this marathon last year to help build some base fitness.



**Training:**

Good but not great. Did a 1 hour 38min half in September 2024 on a undulating/hilly course (depending on your definition ha, 180m of elevation change), averaged 40km a week, but found I’d regularly pick up niggles. Had 3 weeks off in August 2024 with achilles issue, small worries around shin splints coming back etc through winter and then a week fully off at the end of January ill. Tried my best to do bike training where possible, but it definitely disrupted things and caused my weekly mileage to sometimes vary quite a bit.



My longest run was 34k 6 weeks prior and I underestimated fueling, struggling badly in the last 5k. Averaged 5min 30kms until the the last 5k with 7min kms!



I did not follow a specific plan (which I know isn’t ideal!) and generally tried to gradually increase mileage, one long run a week, one tempo kind of session and the rest with zone 2 running.



**Planning a target time:**

I know a lot of people say just finishing your first marathon is an achievement, but I found it hard to not have some time goal in mind. I settled on an A goal of 3hours 25, B goal of 3 hours 30 and keeping the C goal as finishing. I planned to get to half way on target for 3 hours 27/28min, and then increase speed if feeling good.



**Final month to the race + taper:**

I spent a lot of my last few long runs trying to test race pace, but neglecting the longer distances. For example, 3 x 7k at race pace with 1km easy, or 3 x 7k, with 6k at race pace, 1k slightly faster etc. I really wanted to test whether my target pace for 3hours 25 min was realistic. I got a bad cold with 4 weeks to go that took a week off my training, I decided to continue with a hard week of training 3 weeks to 2 weeks to go, before cutting mileage in half with 2 weeks to 1 week, and final week being easy runs with a few Kms at race pace.



**Race weekend:**

I knew the advice for a destination marathon of ‘don’t spend the day before sightseeing’ and thought I’d be fine with avoiding this. In reality, I was with my partner and I felt bad/silly suggesting we basically do nothing.  I already knew I was getting to bed early, keeping it to a 1 drink minimum etc so already wasn't being the most fun companion. Ended up doing a bit of sightseeing, but nothing too heavy - around 8000 steps and made sure to relax from 4pm onwards, aside from going out for dinner.



**Race day:**



**Fueling:** My plan was a Maurten gel every 22minutes. I initially tried every 30 minutes in training but found I needed more, so settled on this. Had a few caffeinated gels designed for the later stages. I decided on the day to bring my phone with me - which combined with the gels made my shorts feel too heavy and bounce as I ran. I ran with 2 gels in each hand to stop this, which was perfectly fine.



**Pre race:** Generally felt pretty comfortable waking up and no real nerves - had a ‘what will be will be attitude’.  Ate some porridge 2.5 hours before and brought 2 croissants to munch on for the walk to the start and 30 minutes before. Porta toilets/potties were horrendous, glad I remembered toilet roll (but forgot anti bac!). Start pens were well organised. I was running with a friend who was in the 3 hour 30 to 3hour 45 block, I was meant to be in the 3 hours 15 to 30 one, but I managed to start in the one behind. They seemed to be fine with this as long as you were moving to a slower block (they were very strict around not moving to a faster one)- but I didn’t ask too many questions to confirm as I got waved through!



**Race itself up to 21km:** Felt pretty comfortable, had agreed with my friend to be very strict with a slow first few kms, with getting to half way at a 4:54 per km average. I felt some nerves where I’d get a little tired, or feel a small ache somewhere in my body and worry I wasn’t as relaxed as I should be. Looking back post event I was fine, but I think knowing I should feel completely fine at this stage made me a bit of a hypochondriac! Gels were working well.



**21km to 30km:** Generally felt fine, had some of my faster kms and tried to hold myself back. Think again I had some anxiety wondering what was going to happen post 30km when things get real hard.

**30km to 35km:** 30km to 33km were fine, and then suddenly things felt a lot harder, like I was having to put a lot more effort in. The sun started coming out pretty strong (which felt a shock after many months of cold weather in the UK), but I don’t think this had a massive impact on my performance. My pace starts to drop, but not significantly - it felt 3 hours 30 was still possible.



**35km to finish:** I was trying to hold on without significantly losing time, which worked until 38km where things progressively got worse, each step got harder and every KM felt like it was taking double the amount of time. I found water stations at this stage really stressful, with lots of people very tried trying to grab at things. I missed taking water at one of the stations, and combined with the heat it felt like a massive set back in my mind at the time. The last few kms I really just wanted to walk, and it was a case of just grinding it out and keeping some kind of pace. Managed to increase pace a little in the last km to the finish.



**Overall thoughts:** Although I didn’t hit A or B goals, I’m really happy with how it went - I really enjoyed it and I escaped without injury or issue. My drop off in the later stages, I initially wondered if I should attribute some to fueling, or to the heat - but in all honesty I think it was a simple case of not doing enough long runs replicating marathon duration. My muscles simply didn’t have enough experience with this feeling, hence the marked but not horrendous drop off.



**Next steps:** I wanted to do this first one before deciding if I’d ever do another marathon. I think the answer is yes, but probably Autumn 2026. Until then, my plan is to gradually build up mileage, add a more structured plan (I’ve bought Advanced Marathoning, and some more resistance/strength work to stop these annoying short term injuries.



Any ideas, thoughts, feedback greatly appreciated!

I am relatively new to running “seriously,” averaging about 20-30 mpw over the past 3ish years. I’ve done several trail races (two 50k, one marathon) and one road race (HM), but never a road marathon, so I wanted to train for speed, since I’m used to enjoying Z1-2 efforts on the trails! 

My goal was 3:25, a BQ (I am 33F). I didn’t have the best sense of my MP since I had only run on quite hilly trails (4+ hr was my PR), but I estimated I could achieve a BQ based on last year’s HM PR (1:38). 

##Training
I VERY LOOSELY followed Pfitz 18/55 plan, but often made adjustments due to a busy schedule (new dog and 10 hr shifts at the hospital). I averaged about 35-45 mpw, ramping up to 52 miles on peak weeks including two 20-mile long runs and several 18-19 mile long runs over the training cycle. Dropped strength training in January (again, due to time constraints), but focused on mostly Z2 efforts with one long run and two or three speed workouts each week (strides, hill repeats, tempos). Had to cut short a lot of Pfitz’s mid-week long runs, but still had markedly higher mileage than I was used to, even with two or three rest days per week. Listened to my body and did NOT get injured. Got sick only 3 days in the training cycle, too. Super grateful for that! 

Training was fun because I’d never focused on road running before, so I PR’d in absolutely everything (5k 20:25, 10k 42:35, 10 mile 1:11). 

##Pre-race
I tapered super aggressively over 3 weeks, running only once or twice in short distances on race week, with two full rest days (but plenty of walking) two days before race day.  Focused on good sleep, minimal booze, lots of carbs, and hydrating well especially the last two days.

On race day, I got up at 5:45; slept decently. Breakfast of leftover pancakes and oatmeal. Missed my pre-race warm up/ shakeout because the event was so crowded! 

##Race day details 
Weather: Couldn’t have been better! Sunny, crisp, low humidity (for Van), about 48F in the morning with a high of somewhere in the mid 50s. 

Event: SO CROWDED— But then again, I am used to low-key trail races! Line for bathroom was colossal, so had to squat behind the Porta in order to make it to my corral in time. (Sorry.) I was able to squeeze my way to the end of the first corral before the gun time. 

Gear/fueling: I only brought 7 gels which fit in my race shorts, relying on well-stocked water stations along the way. Took one gel 5 min before gun time, and I was militant about taking one gel every 30 min to avoid bonks (SIS isotonic gels). 

##Race recap 
What a glorious course! It was rolling with plenty of gradual uphill/downhills. The city itself is gorgeous, clean and modern, contrasting with the lush forests of UBC’s campus and the mountain views along the Stanley Park seawall. Morale was high because of all the crowds of spectators throughout the whole course! Volunteers handed out cups of water and electrolyte juice every 3k or so. 

I started conservatively because of the hills in the beginning, but quickly realized I could handle a faster pace than my original target of 7:40-ish/mile. The biggest hill was the infamous Camosun, which I’d built up to be way worse in my head than it was! It was also early at mile 6, which helped. The course was mostly flat on the latter half of the race, so by mile 20 (the flat seawall) I amped it up some gears! Felt good to be passing people at this point, even with burning quads! My militant fueling (one gel per 30 min) helped a lot, I think. 

Overall, I was thrilled by my time (3:15, ten mins faster than my goal) and negative splits! (Though now I’m wondering if I should’ve started out faster?!)

I guess I have to go to Boston next year! Might start making way loftier goals— like sub 3? (Gasp!)  Beautiful day and beautiful time. Shout-out to the guy with the bib name “NOTSURE” (get the reference?)!

Not going to make this a long post but thought I would share since there are some pretty stale race reports from this one.

OVERALL  
For the most part, the experience on the course was phenomenal and the support of the Marines at all of the aid stations, medical tents, pre-race, and post-race was above and beyond (as you would expect from the Marines). I grew up in DC and as I have gotten into running marathons, this quickly went to the top of the list of ones I was keen on doing. However, I will not be coming back to do this race ever again unless there are major overhauls.

COURSE:  
The majority of the course is really a delight to run through - Spout Run parkway, Georgetown, Rock Creek parkway, The National Mall, even Haines Point to an extent. The crowd support in those areas is insane and it really makes a difference since this is a challenging course. But there are two absolutely soul-sucking stretches of this race with little to no crowd support and unfortunately those stretches come at miles 20-22 and 24-25.5. The 20-22 mile stretch on the freeway bridge over the river was breaking people left and right. I find it hard to believe that they can't come up with a better course that doesn't go over that awful bridge. There are other bridges that could be used that are shorter and more picturesque.

Also, MAJORLY important: do not go to this race to qualify for Boston or to chase a PR. I don't feel like I took any tangents poorly or took wide turns in this race and yet I ran 26.57 miles. Nearly everyone's Strava from this race is somewhere between 26.5-26.7 miles.

LOGISTICS:  
One thing to clear up from prior year posts is that they seem to have gotten better with the corrals. They seemed organized and there were course people preventing you from going into a corral you didn't belong in. I experienced very little in the way of having to pass people going far too slow at the start (I have seen this in race reports from several years back). There is also a chip detection pad at the turnaround on Rock Creek Parkway, so gone are the days where people would be able to cheat on that section of the course. So I applaud the race people for implementing that since it seems crazy there wouldn't be a clock pad there.

I found the expo location in Maryland to be a pain to get to and get out of. After the expo, the line to take the shuttle back across the river to the Metro station was insanely long. Give yourself plenty of time to get the expo stuff done or get there as early as you possibly can. The post-race festival area was kind of a hot mess. You come out of the finisher's chute up the hill into Rosslyn and then all of a sudden you're out with the public/spectators. There isn't a gradual opening up of the chute, so there were all sorts of people criss-crossing each other, stepping on your feet, stopping to take selfies with family, etc. They had the trucks with everyone's bags at the complete opposite end of the festival... that should be one of the first things available to the runners. Again, allow yourself plenty of time to GTFO of there - the line for the Metro was about two blocks long.

TL;DR - a great experience overall, but this seems like a one-and-done kind of race in my opinion. A course overhaul or better pre/post race logistics would change my mind."

# Training

37F, this is my 9th marathon, albeit with a nearly 10 year gap between numbers 5 and 6.

I took a few days off from running after the Montréal Marathon in September (you can check my post history for the race report and my training plan, but the tl:dr is I tried to run a marathon shortly after my friend died and it did not go well). I then took it very slow and easy for the next two weeks. I still did not feel great mentally and was hesitant to push it so didn’t do too much speedwork this training cycle. If my pace slowed because I suddenly didn’t want to run fast anymore or I started crying halfway through a run, I just kinda rolled with it. This was a challenge for me because I’m an extremely intense, competitive person but I was motivated by never wanting to feel like I did during that race ever again. I also went to therapy and started meditating again, plus took time off from work. Eventually, I started feeling a little better and began to focus on Philly.

At the beginning of November I ran a half marathon time trial, using the course for a local race. This was mostly to check my mental fitness. Day of, there were 15- 20 mph winds but I’d heard that Philly was windy too so decided to go for it. I was aiming for 1:30, but during a 4 mile section of nonstop headwinds my pace dropped to 7:30/mile. I was tempted to give up but instead at the turnaround I found another gear and threw down a series of 6:30 minute miles to the finish. My time was 1:30:05, which was a huge confidence boost. 

I entered into the taper feeling healthier than I had a few months ago. Unfortunately, a week before the race, my partner declared he was leaving me for someone else because I was still too sad all the time. Fortunately, nothing fuels me quite like spite. 

# Pre-race

I flew into Philly Friday night. On Saturday I picked up my bib as soon as the expo opened. No one else was there, so it was very quick and easy. I don't ever do a shakeout run so instead wandered around the city a bit and looked at the sights. I ate delicious donuts and got catcalled a lot by strangers- the former helped my bruised ego a lot more than the latter. I also watched Rocky because when in Rome, but also I wanted to remind myself that trading my boxing career for running marathons was the right call, as my chosen sport no longer includes getting punched in the face. When I told myself this again during the race, it actually did help but YMMV. 

I fell asleep at a reasonable hour on Saturday, then after dreaming of running the race all night, woke up at 4:45 am to actually run the race. This was by far the biggest race I’d run so that definitely contributed to my nerves. It was about 40 degrees at the start, which is perfect racing weather. I chose to wear shorts, gloves, and a long sleeve shirt, plus a sweatshirt I planned on ditching at the start. I’d worn Superblasts for my last race but my ankles hurt for days afterwards and then I lost a toenail, so I swapped them out for Endorphin Pros. This was the right call.

I was staying less than a mile from the start so walked over. I saw a number of interesting looking people doing interesting things at that hour but managed to keep my focus. A couple people wished me good luck, which was lovely.

I’d repeatedly been warned to get to the start early due to security lines. At 5:45 am, there was not a single other person in line. I used the porta potty (no line), dropped off my bag (no line), then hung out at the warming tent where I just kinda sat there and stared into space for awhile. Honestly, I think it was beneficial. About 20 minutes before the start I decided to use the porta potty again and suddenly the lines were monstrous. I was still waiting when the elites started so I dashed into corral B, only for the start to be delayed a couple more minutes so I probably could have made it. 

# Race

I was running with the 3:10 pacers (they were amazing and perfect) and it was very crowded for the first few miles. I detoured to a porta potty at the first aid station then quickly caught back up. I tried to stay on the outside edge of the group because one guy kept taking selfies and I wanted no part of that and another guy kept madly dashing from one side of the road to the other for unknown reasons.  I thought about asking him at the end what his mileage was but didn’t want to be rude. I am still wondering this, though.

Aid stations were not as much of a shitshow as I’d feared and I stopped at most for water. At least once per race I forget the word for water and get Gatorade or whatever instead. This is entirely my own fault, the Philly volunteers were wonderful. Shoutout to the volunteer at the last aid station who watched me drop three cups of water in a row then reassured me I was doing great. I needed that.

I keep hearing that the first 10 miles of the marathon should feel easy. I don’t think I’ve ever felt “good” or confident during a race, ever, at any point, including before I actually start running. Usually I feel like I’m just barely hanging on and the wheels could fall off at any moment. That being said, I really tried to relax and enjoy the experience. I had people to run with and the weather was perfect! The crowds were great, there were excellent signs (“you could have just gone to therapy” was a favorite) and there was lots of cool things to look at! I was particularly fascinated by a group of very enthusiastic furries and the number of aid stations that offered booze (at least 4, by my count). 

I live in a very hilly area so I barely noticed any uphills during the race. However, there were a few pleasant downhill sections during the first half. There was a steep downhill section heading into Manayunk and I became convinced that we had to run back up it but we in fact did not. 

Mile 16 was where it all fell apart last race but this time I was still hanging on. No cramps, no injuries, no mental breakdowns. My goal was to stay with the group until mile 20 then pull ahead. So at the Manayunk turnaround, I started to speed up. It wasn’t awful. I kept going. At a certain point I realized there was in fact no looming uphill (apparently this is why people look at the course map ahead of time) and really decided to haul ass for the remainder of the race. I was picking off other runners, only half felt like I was going to die, and doing my usual bargaining with myself (only 3 more miles. 3 miles is your easy run! This is easy!) all the way to the finish.

I briefly cried after crossing the finish line, which seemed to startle the photographer. Then I got my medal (obsessed with how it actually rings) then walked slowly and painfully back to my Airbnb. A couple strangers congratulated me on the race and one guy offered to give me a ride which I politely declined even though my legs were really tired.

# Post-race

Three days out, I’m much less sore than I have been in previous races. In my last race, I started out too fast then crashed and burned and felt terrible for the last 8 miles, but this race I felt fine all the way to the end and had no problem speeding up. So that makes me wonder how much quicker I could have run. A year ago 3:08 seemed unattainable, now I'm thinking how close I can get to 3 hours. I've been feeling fine at \~65 mile weeks, and now that I suddenly have a lot more free time in my schedule, maybe I'll increase my mileage over the winter. I do have access to a treadmill for snowy or icy days.

I have a half planned in March (which I am racing because I want that sub 1:30) then Boston in April (which I am not racing because I want to enjoy the experience). Not sure what else I’ll run this year but probably another fall marathon. Open to suggestions!

1kqkxor,2025-05-19 19:36:01+00:00,Willlocas,,AdvancedRunning,/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1kqkxor/race_report_colfax_marathon_2025/,Race Report: Colfax Marathon 2025,"Ran my first official one yesterday at Denver's Colfax Marathon. I had ran the full 26.2 distance one time prior to this a little bit over a year ago by myself with a friend bike pacing and ran it in 3:14:xx. Yesterday, I got a BQ with 2:41:10 and 9th place overall. Very happy with this result.

Colfax is a city road race that stretches from City Park downtown into the Lakewood area and is, I believe, the only marathon that goes through the Denver area. I did not run any of the course prior to race day, as I did the majority of my training in Colorado Springs, about an hour south of Denver and about 500-800 feet higher in elevation than Denver.

I am 23 years old, male, 5'8"" and about 150 pounds.

I trained pretty intensively for this after registering back in September, building pretty quickly from 40 MPW to 60 MPW and maintaining 50-60 MPW for 7 months. I did not follow any plan and I had no training partners or coach. I raced a hilly trail 10k in January in 36:40 and a road half marathon in February in 1:18:20.

My training was pretty random. I often ran either very early in the morning or late at night on the treadmill. I often would start running and invent a workout in my head within my warmup miles. It mainly consisted of tempo runs, fartleks, 1-2 km repeats faster than my goal pace, and my weekly long run ranged from 14-20 miles. I did a 22 miler three weeks out from the race at goal MP, which I was initially planning on being around 6:20, shooting for a 2:45:xx finish at Colfax. I considered this to be a lofty goal that I was uncertain on reaching. I was nervous going into this race as I had lofty goals for my first official marathon and was nervous about hitting the wall and crashing out bad.

As far as fueling during the race, I tried to get a gulp or two of water or gatorade at almost every aid station but mostly spilled it all on myself. I took a GU gel at mile 8 and another one at mile 17. The second gel went down pretty rough and I felt like it was giving me some heartburn due to the saltiness and so I sort of pulled trig and threw it up a little bit and felt a lot better after that.

I raced this completely off of feel. I did not train with a watch and tracked all of runs on my phone with the strava app, so that is how I raced as well. I pulled out my phone to check pace at mile 9 and was unnerved to see that I was averaging about 45 seconds faster than my goal pace, so I was feeling like the crash and burn was imminent, but I opted to hang on to it as best I could rather than relent. I raced the first 14 miles with no headphones in. I am very motivated by music when running so putting in headphones at mile 14 gave me a good midway boost. Maybe not the smartest pacing but all in all it did work out pretty well. Here are my splits:

Mile 1 - 5:36

Mile 2 - 5:39

Mile 3 - 5:29

Mile 4 - 5:16

Mile 5 - 5:22

Mile 6 - 5:35

Mile 7 - 5:40

Mile 8 - 5:54

Mile 9 - 5:35

Mile 10 - 5:48

Mile 11 - 5:45

Mile 12 - 5:49

Mile 13 - 6:02

Mile 14 - 6:02

Mile 15 - 6:07

Mile 16 - 6:05

Mile 17 - 5:42

Mile 18 - 5:51

Mile 19 - 6:01

Mile 20 - 6:07

Mile 21 - 6:02

Mile 22 - 5:54

Mile 23 - 6:18

Mile 24 - 6:20

Mile 25 - 6:06

Mile 26 - 6:39

Mile 27 (My strava tracking some how ended up with an extra mile, not sure why, but the course was definitely just 26.2) - 6:27

As mentioned, I was pretty nervous about crashing hard, but luckily hit the wall around mile 20 and was able to hang on to low 6's with both of my hamstrings cramped into knots and my right calf in about the same boat. I am proud of myself for this effort, as I trained for this in the midst of completing the first year of a master's degree and while working/interning on top of school. Really happy to have gotten this Boston qualification, as that was my primary goal and I am thrilled about the prospect of running that race next year. This was a very enjoyable race, with multiple landmark locations around the city that it went through, such as the football stadium, art and design campus, and an agonizing jaunt through a hilly neighborhood for miles 12-15. There was also a pretty devastating hill right before the 25th mile mark that really put me through the wringer. I was sitting at about third place for most of the race trying to keep pace with the relay teams, but mostly on my own as far as the individual marathon field went. I was caught and passed by 6 guys  who went out a bit slower than me and had some more left in the tank for mile 17 to the finish.

My next race scheduled for this year is the Pikes Peak Marathon, a trail race widely considered to be one of the most supremely difficult marathons in the country, due to the 7,000 feet of elevation gain, exposure on the trail when getting above the treeline, and the fact that it takes most of the front runners 5-6 hours to complete. Goal for this one is mainly just to finish and enjoy it, so it is less daunting to me than this Colfax race, as the idea of running the 26.2 at such an aggressive pace had me very anxious going into it."

### Training
I subscribed to the Hal Higdon Intermediate 1 Program at the beginning of July, leaving me about 3.5 months to train for this one. It did initially warn me that race day was a little soon for that plan, but as long as I had a good base it would be ok. Since this would not be my first marathon, and my average weekly mileage was around 35 mpw at the time, I went ahead with it.

Everything was going absolutely on track until I suffered an injury to my achilles and soleus at the beginning of September which caused me to miss out on all three of my 20 mile runs. Up to that point I had only gotten in a few runs longer than 16 miles, namely a couple of 17s and one 18. Therefore my weekly mileage dropped considerably while I was carefully nursing my leg back to normal.

Unfortunately, recovery was slow, so two weeks prior to the race, I decided to take the entire week off from running since my leg still was not 100%. The week of the race, I only got two runs in, one 3 miler and one 4 miler. So I felt VERY undertrained for this one. Because of this, I scrapped all of my previous goals, which included beating my 2024 Cleveland time of 3:48:19.

### Pre-race
While I felt undertrained, I felt fairly confident in my ability to at least finish the race. But I also decided that if at any point during the race I felt like it was necessary, I would DNF to avoid an injury. On top of that, our hotel cancelled our room at 6pm the night before the race as we were heading there because of a “plumbing issue” and refused to rebook us or find us another hotel. It took us several hours to find a place to stay, which was twice as far away from the race as the hotel was, and we ended up not arriving there until around 9pm. This left me with little time to get my gear prepared for the next morning.

### Race day
The morning of the race, I got up around 4:30am and felt very tired as I didn’t get much sleep the night before. But I did as much prep and stretching as time allowed, and my legs felt surprisingly good.

I then headed out to the event and arrived about an hour before the race started, wanting to try and use the restroom one last time. Unfortunately, the lines were quite long, and by the time I got out of there, I had no time left to go to the gear check, so my poor wife had to carry my backpack around with her all morning. I made it into the corral with about 5 minutes to spare and did as much additional stretching as I could while standing shoulder to shoulder with my fellow runners.

#### Race start
When the race started, the weather was perfect; high 40s and clear skies. I was determined to not overdo it the first few miles like I had done in Cleveland earlier this year, and set my Garmin to alert me if I broke 8:25 pace. This helped me considerably, and I believe had positive results in the last 6 miles, which I’ll explain later.

Several miles into the race, once I got up and over the Ambassador Bridge and into Canada, I realized my legs were feeling quite strong and that gave me some motivation. I still stuck with my pace of no faster than 8:30 since that’s my “easy pace”, and I’m unlikely to injure myself at that pace, which was the most important thing to me.

At miles 10 through 12, I went through a spell of fatigue which had me worried, but I got a second wind and started the back half strong.

Miles 14 through 18 went off without too much issue, but mile 19 had a short but sharp climb at the end that winded me.

Starting at mile 20, while I don’t feel I “hit the wall”, as I still maintained a steady pace, the last 6 miles were definitely slower than my normal pace. However, I feel that if I had overdone it at the start of the race, the last 6 would have been absolutely brutal, so sticking to my max pace I believe helped me a lot at the end. I did end up walking through the fluid stations in those last 6 miles, and also took three, 10 second walk breaks as well. That was a first for me; I’ve never had to take walk breaks in a race, but I was adamant that I would listen to my body and do what was necessary to not injure myself. Those brief respites really helped as well, and every time I started running again I felt renewed energy.

About a half mile before the finish line, my brother, who had done the half marathon, met and ran with me for about a quarter mile (until he had to get off the route since he had already finished), and that gave me a big boost and I was able to hit the finish line at about a 5:30 pace (I love sprinting to the finish) with an overall finish time of 3:52:58, finishing only a few minutes slower than my Cleveland time (3:48:20).

### Post-race
I was definitely exhausted afterwards, and last night and today am more sore and stiffer than after any other race. But I have no pain, and no worrisome spots that would indicate an injury. So all in all, I consider it a big win since in spite of my injury and missing so much training, I was able to finish the race, and only a few minutes slower than my last one. I’m signed up for Cleveland in May 2025, so hopefully I can set a new PR there!

### What's next
I have a 15k ""Hot Chocolate Run"" coming up in four weeks. I will take this entire week off, and then start training for that. While 9 miles is not a big deal, I want to try and hit a PR. Currently, my 15k PR is 1:05:52 (7:04 pace), and I want to bring that down to 1:05:00 (or 7:00 pace).

My next race after that *as of right now* is Cleveland Marathon in May of 2025. I want to work hard and get down to what my goal for *this* marathon was, 3:30:00. I plan on using Hal Higdon again as I was overall please with the program.

### Final thoughts
The race itself was fun, but not as well organized and laid out as my only other marathon, which was Cleveland earlier this year. A lot of other races, including smaller events, send out helpful reminders in the days leading up to race day, but this one did not. I only received one email about some changes to the expo due to the presidential candidates scheduling speeches at the same convention center. Additionally, the post-race event was laid out somewhat poorly, with runners having to walk through a rather long chute to finally exit the fenced in area, and then double all the way back to get to the vendors. There was also zero freebies at the end, such as pizza and beer, which literally every other race I've done has had. So that was a little disappointing. But the experience of being able to run across an international border and back was pretty unique, so I still am glad I did this race.

*Training*

After running my first marathon in January, I had planned to take a long break before getting back into my next racing season in the fall. Unexpectedly, I had an opportunity to travel to Cincinnati the weekend of the Flying Pig marathon, a race which I always wanted to run. I decided to start a limited training program, focusing on high mileage and easy runs, with the goal of simply finishing the race and enjoying the experience. My plan was to ramp up to a 20-mile run and see if I felt as though I could complete the marathon at that point. If I did, I would register. 

I started at my normal base mileage of ~35 miles/week and gradually increased over about two months to a peak of 75 miles per week. For this training cycle, I did not include any speed work at all, and focused purely on increasing mileage through easy runs. My goal for the race was just to stay on my feet, and I felt as though a lack of mileage was my primary challenge during training for my first marathon. I did three 20+ mile runs during this block - one 20, one 21, and one 22. Each time I actually extended the mileage that I planned because I felt so good during the run, and for the 22-miler I ran significant negative splits without really intending to. 

I felt very confident in my preparation and my ability to finish the race - something I hadn’t felt during my first training cycle. In fact, I felt so confident that I signed up not for the marathon, but for the challenge: a 1-mile fun run, a 10k and 5k the day before the marathon, and then the marathon itself. I thought they would be a good shakeout for the marathon if I just took it easy, and I wanted to challenge myself. 

I also shortened my taper for this cycle to two weeks, and felt much better about that than the three-week taper I used last time. I still felt a little heavy and tight in the week before the race, but it didn’t have a chance to really set in like it did before. I ran only a few miles the week of the challenge, knowing that I’d be getting my warmups in during the early races. 

*The Race*

I want to focus on the marathon here, so I won’t talk as much about the earlier races, but I should give a little context. My intent was to run the mile on Friday night close to all-out, take the 10k on Saturday morning very easy, and then do the 5k at marathon pace to settle into my groove a little. Those plans went out the window as I struggled to control my pace in the 10k and ended up setting a PB by several seconds. After a 3-hour weather delay for some **intense** thunderstorms and in high humidity, I decided to turn off my pace tracking for the 5k to avoid any internal pressure to speed up and run it at a very easy pace…and set a PB by nearly a minute. I was happy with my results, but worried about what they meant for the marathon the next day. 

The morning of the race I headed into town early to be sure I had time to get to the start line. I had some coffee and pretzels, situated myself in my corral, and reminded myself to hold the pace back and just try to make it to the finish line. There are some steep hills and then a long, steep downslope (which I find almost as difficult) in the first half of the course, and I told myself if I could just make it to halfway, I’d be in great shape. 

The first 4-5 miles (across the bridge into Kentucky and back, and then through downtown) were relatively easy, although I felt a little tight and heavy. I also noticed almost immediately that the mileage announcements from Strava were well ahead of the posted mile markers, which meant that I wasn’t sure whether the pace it was calculating was accurate. The pace the app was telling me was faster than I wanted to run, but I thought I was probably going slower than that…so I decided to just maintain a steady pace that felt good to me. 

Mile 6-7 was steeply uphill as we climbed to Eden Park and the overlook over the river. This was the part of the race I was terrified of all through training, as my previous running (in Florida) just wouldn’t measure up…or so I thought. To my surprise, I found the hills only moderately difficult. I had no trouble maintaining pace, and didn’t feel overly tired. When I arrived at the top of the hill and looked out over the river in the morning light, I began to think that I might make it all the way through the race after all. I worked my way through a couple of additional inclines and then suffered through the long decline in miles 11-13. I was tiring a little, but still feeling good. My fueling strategy (fruit snacks every 3 miles) was going well, helped along by cookies, chocolate, and other goodies handed out by spectators. 

As we got into Mariemont around mile 15, though, I really started to flag. This was the farthest point of the course, and I started to wonder whether I would be able to make it all the way back to the finish. I focused on being consistent, getting in a groove, and keeping my eyes on the next step. I told myself that I wasn’t going to give up now, and that I had people who believed that I could do this, even when I doubted myself. 

I usually don’t take fluids during my races or training runs (yes, I know, you can judge me, but it works for me). I really struggle to drink while running, and stopping to drink makes it incredibly hard to get moving again. Around Mile 18, though, I was feeling a need for water, and so I took a cup and just kind of threw it at my mouth. I got about half down and the rest slopped all over me…which wasn’t a bad thing. I started doing the same at every aid station - I wasn’t sure why I felt the need to, but it seemed to help. I found out later that they had put the race under red flag conditions for heat and humidity, which explained a lot. That just shows how much attention I was paying!

At about mile 20, I started to think I wouldn’t make it. I had stopped to walk at mile 23 of my first marathon, and I started to bargain with myself to make it just that far. I had started out ahead of most of the pacers and had seen a number of them pass me throughout the race, but as I watched the 3:35 group pass me now I told myself that sub-4 might still be within reach. I slowed down my pace and muscled through, taking more water whenever I could. My plan at that point was to make it to mile 23 before I needed to walk, and then to try to stick with the 3:50 pacer as long as possible when they caught up to me so that I might still hang on for a time under four hours. 

At mile 23, I told myself that I could go just a little bit farther if I kept my pace down. And then something odd happened…I started to feel better. I got a second wind from somewhere and my legs didn’t feel as leaden. At mile 24 I told myself that I only had two miles left…I could finish without walking! I also slowly realized that I hadn’t seen the 3:45 pace group pass me yet. That didn’t seem right, so I thought maybe I had missed them. At mile 25, though, there was a clock - and when I saw it, I was in shock. I hadn’t trusted the Strava announcements, but the clock was clear…not only was I going to make sub-4, but I might even have a chance at 3:45. With only a mile to go, I pushed my pace as much as I felt that I could. I knew I could make it, I pushed myself for just that extra drop of effort…and as I crossed the finish line, I couldn’t believe that I had actually done it. Not only did I finish, but I took more than 8 minutes off my previous time - on a difficult course, under harsh conditions, and after setting two other PRs the day before. I was…and am…elated and amazed at what I could do. 

*Takeaways*

This experience showed me how important relatively high mileage training is, at least for me. I’m already making plans to slowly ramp my base up over the summer to allow for high mileage weeks during my fall training cycle. Combined with some additional speed work, I’m hoping that I’ll improve even more for my next races. I also really appreciated the two-week taper rather than three. I will definitely incorporate that in the future as well. I don’t want to leave my race in training, but I think I do best when the race is as much an extension of the training pattern as possible. 

I’m also absolutely floored at what I’m able to do when I put my mind to it. A year ago, I thought I wouldn’t be able to run a single marathon. Now I’ve done two in four months, and set four personal records in three days last weekend. Even in hard conditions, even with challenges in front of me…I succeeded. I saw someone else comment about their marathon experience recently that they wondered what else they had underestimated themselves about. I’m beginning to wonder the same thing. If I can do this - me, who couldn’t run a mile without stopping five years ago - what can’t I do? 

I’m already looking forward to more challenges to come, including Dopey in January 2025. Here’s to finding more hard things that I most definitely CAN do!!"

### Background
35 M, I've been running for about 10 years, only past 2.5ish with consistent/decent mileage (1000 miles each in 2022 and 2023, previous few years were more like 500-600, even less before that).  In the first few years running worked my way up through the distances with just the goal of finishing, all the way to my first marathon in 2019 where I had the classic fall apart after mile 18, finishing in 4:12:38.  Looking back at it, mainly a training issue, I didn't have the mileage (peaked at maybe 40 mpw) nor the experience to properly pace myself.  Since then, have steadily focused on better training and setting PRs in the 1 mile, 5k, 10k, and HM.  In the past 2 years I have done Pfitz 12/47 plans for HMs and chunks of his other 5k/10k plans, leading to a 1:40:21 in 2022, and 1:39:28 in 2023.  1 mile PR has been 6 even the past 3 years, 5k last year was 20:10, and 10k last year was about 42:30.

### Training
I used Pfitz's 18/55 plan, with some additional base building prior to starting the plan, (~35 mpw 8 weeks from plan start, 40 mpw for 4 weeks into the plan).  I had a rough target of 3:30 for this upcoming marathon based on last year's PRs, but for the first few LT/MP workouts had to run them considerably slower due to heat/humidity (eg. Mid-September 16 w/12 at MP of 8:20-8:25 at 73 F, 71 dew point).

For this block, key workouts/races (once weather cooled off): 

10/8: 11 w/7 @ LT - ran these 7 mi at an average of 7:12, was hard but doable. 

10/19: HM PR of 1:36:27, with a 1 week taper (40 mpw that race week) on a hilly course 

10/26: 18 w/14 @MP averaging 7:58 

10/27: 5 mi race at 6:53 (my legs definitely held me back here but expected that given the workout the day before)

11/13: 10K solo time trial: 42:22 (10ks are literally the worst)

Final training paces, noting these all dropped by about 1 min/mi as temps went from 90-50: 

Easy: 8:45-9:45 

GA: 8:30-9:30 

Long/endurance/med long: 9:30 -> 8:00-8:15 

MP: ~7:50-8:10 

LT: ~7:10-7:15 

VO2: 6:30-6:40


### Pre-race
Based on a combination of workouts/races/paces/HR data, I was very confident in 3:30/sub 8.  What I was unsure of was how the race would go past mile 20.  My early long runs were hard, but the last 19 miler and 20 miler felt good, and both finished around an 8:00 using HR.  Runanalyze was predicting a 3:23 or so, but over the years I've learned I am much happier with a negative split than a positive one.  Since a massive PR was pretty much guaranteed, I wanted to stick to a conservative goal and learn what I could do at the end of the race.  I knew I had the speed, but wasn't sure I had the distance.

I picked this race because it's flat and fast, and being the end of November would be cold (most of my PRs have been set in December, I seem to do best in about 35-40 F weather).  Maybe overshot this a bit, as it was about 25 F and windy at race start.  Opted to keep my long sleeve on over the tank top for the start, because I was freezing.

Nutrition plan was pretty simple, Gu at the start, then every 4 miles, packing one extra in case I wanted it around 23.  Handheld with 5 scoops of gatorade, that I planned to top off with water around 7-8 and 18-20.  Did all of my long runs this way and never had issues.

### Race
First mile was a decent downhill, not too much noteworthy other than making sure I didn't get ahead of myself.

2-8: Settled into a small group, around mile 3 chatted with the guy next to me and ran with him until about mile 7.  Pace through here was slower than intended, but we had a pretty decent crosswind/headwind on the way out and I had wanted to keep the beginning easy.  These miles felt good, HR was where I expected it, a little behind schedule but not too concerned.  At mile 7 took off the long sleeve, though I had been considering it for a few miles, so probably should have taken it off sooner.  I was definitely sweating despite the cold and wind.

8-13: With me stopping to take off the long sleeve my buddy and I split up, and once I got back into it I wanted to get back on track.  Starting pushing the pace closer to 8:00 but was still holding back a little bit, combination of wanting to not push too hard through 13 and dealing with the wind.

13-20: Having turned around, the wind was now slightly tail (but still cross/shifty) and there was a slight downhill, so focused on cutting my predicted finish back to 3:30 but still holding back a bit to make sure I had enough for the final 10k.  Still felt strong through these miles, legs were starting to feel some of the pain, but nothing different than what I felt in training.

20-23: Focused on maintaining pace, hurt was settling into the legs, but still felt strong aerobically and was convinced I wasn't going to bonk at this point.

23-26.2: Kept trying to push as much as I could, counting down the mile markers.  Once I could see the finish line, probably half a mile left, I was able to kick even more, especially seeing my wife and kids shortly before the finish line.  

Legs were screaming through these final miles, had maybe the slightest tinge in my left hamstring, but otherwise still no concerns that I would finish at this pace.  At this point I stopped checking my watch, aside from the occasional “where is the mile marker??? oh still .15 to go...” and focused on effort level.

Another thing to note, given the small size of this race and my negative split, I was essentially running solo from 8 to the finish.  I train solo and have done a number of solo time trials, so while I would have preferred people to run with, I did have experience running hard solo that helped make this not miserable.

### Post-race
Final time was 3:27:38, first half in 1:46:14, second in 1:41:24.  Obviously thrilled to have nearly perfectly executed the plan, and also grateful that I had been correct in thinking 3:30 was conservative – I would have been crushed if the wheels fell off on this one.  Nothing too eventful post race, had to walk about a mile to the car which was almost as awful as the last 3 miles of the race, but probably good for the legs.

Reflecting on the race and training block, I feel pretty confident going forward in general – over the past few years I have done enough races and training plans to have a better sense of what I can do, how I prefer to run races, and this year have a better sense of RPE on top of a few years of HR training.  My main last question was how I would handle the distance of the full, and while I certainly could have gone out faster for more even splits, I now have a data point on how it feels when it goes to plan.  

With this block I also feel a little more confident in attempting longer distances at comparative paces to my shorter races – I held back on being aggressive as historically there was a big drop off from my 5k/10k paces to HM, but setting a 3 min HM PR on a mini taper, hilly course, 55 and sunny day while training for this full makes me believe the consistent mileage is helping that speed translate. 

My long term goal is likely a BQ, though that's definitely a few years out.  With small kids even getting this 18/55 block in was a challenge, and I know I would need higher mileage for a BQ.  

Next year planning on focusing on short distances again and eek out some more incremental PRs, this December will attempt to finally break 6 in the mile (4th time's the charm, right?) and 20 in the 5k.  No concrete plans for another marathon at the moment – my wife and I have maybe settled into alternating years of who gets preference for their training, and she put up with my mileage this year so I'll give her a break next year lol.

I will say too that the untapered solo 10k time trial was harder than this marathon, cementing my opinion of the 10k being the absolute worst distance to race.

**Training**

Background: started running casually in 2020 during covid and have been running fairly consistently 2/3 times a week for the past few years, but never followed a dedicated training plan. 

Over Christmas I'd been debating what sort of target to set for my first marathon. I'd previously had a half-marathon PB of 1.26.26 at the end of 2024, which I felt put me on the edge of committing to a goal of sub-3 hours and the training that would involve. I was pretty apprehensive, not having any previous experience running the marathon distance or even going beyond 50km weeks before. 

As a relative marathon newbie, I decided to roughly follow the RunnersWorld Sub3 programme (Basically the first plan I found online), while also incorporating parts of my regular running routine. The training block went pretty well, and I managed to peak with a couple of 100km weeks while only missing the odd session. I had a few aches and pains throughout, as expected with the increased training load, but nothing that managed to stop me significantly. Monthly physio visits and a little gym work helped. Weekly, I tried to stick to Monday: Easy 40mins, Tuesday: varying interval track session, Wednesday: Longish run peaking at 20km, Thursday: Tempo run peaking at 16km marathon pace, Friday: rest, Saturday: Park Run or Easy Ks, Sunday: Long Run peaking at 36km. Looking back, the only thing my training probably lacked is a couple more long runs with extra marathon pace included. 

I managed to stay pretty disciplined throughout and felt in good shape heading into the taper, having hit PB's in the 5K (17.31), 10K (37.41) and Half-Marathon (1.20.47) within the 16-week training block. This gave me confidence I was in good shape to execute a sub-3 attempt as long as things went well on race day.

**Pre-race**

Pre-race, I had a couple of shake-out runs in the week leading up and focused on getting my carbs up. I didn’t want to overdo the eating and have digestion issues leading up to the race, so just added a few extra snacks here and there. I was pretty nervous based on the expectations I’d put on myself in the lead up, but felt confident given the position the training had put me in. 

I’m local to Manchester, so didn’t have far to travel. I tried to keep everything as controlled and organised as possible in the build-up. I met up pre-race with a couple of friends as we all had similar goals and tried to control the nerves as best as possible before setting off.   

**Race**

The 3 of us set off together with a plan to hit a 4.10km pace and try and sit just ahead of the crowds near the 3-hour pacer, potentially pushing on in the last 10km or so. At first, the course was quite narrow and busy, so it was hard to get in front of the pacers. I made a small surge around the 7km mark to get into a bit more clear air and away from the crowds, but lost my friends in the process. 

The first half-marathon or so went by pretty smoothly, and I hit my aim of going through in 1.28 bang on - although my heart rate had been creeping up to the mid-170s which caused me some concern. Everyone talks about how challenging marathons are from 30km onwards, but it’s hard to really know what it’s going to feel like until you’re there. I started to feel the fatigue creeping in from 28km, and it just got harder and harder to keep pace from that point onward. I spent the last 15km with my heart rate over 180 and had to battle hard to keep one foot in front of the other.

By UK standards the temps were getting hot and a lot of people were struggling. It didn’t feel like there were enough water stations in the last 10km and I was just dying for some extra drink stations. Luckily I caught my girlfriend around 32km and got some extra electrolytes and fluids onboard. Overall, I had 3 gels, one every 45mins and half a Voom bar near the end but was struggling to keep them down and struggled a bit balancing the fuelling side of things. I felt myself getting slower and slower towards 40km but knew as long as I held on and didn’t stop I could hit my target. Judging by my splits I managed a slight resurgence in the last couple of kilometres and gave it my all in the 500m or so toward the finish line leaving everything out there.

**Post-race**

I’d pictured crossing the finish line so many time during training but in the end celebrations were muted due to sheer exhaustion. My heart rate peaked at 199 and my legs went completely having to be assisted away from the finish by medics. At least it meant I had left everything out there. After I’d come around with the help of the wonderful staff and the long walk to collect medals I overwhelmed with emotion seeing my girlfriend and parents there to greet me at the end. 

Chatting to friends after the race, very few people came away from the race achieving their targets. The conditions made it really tough, but it made me even more grateful I could pull through at the end. "

My thought was, I felt pretty good about hitting sub 4 with my HM performances. 3:30:00 is aggressive, but I figured why not, if I blow up, whatever, it’s just a race (narrator: he did not consider the physical pain he would incur). 

**Background:**

I started running in May of 2023. Prior to that time I had never run more than 3 miles at once. That said, I come from an athlete background, plenty of sports in highschool, played D2 football in college and spent the years since dabbling in rec sports, CrossFit, rock climbing, staying in relatively good shape, but no aerobic background. 27, 6’1, roughly 200lbs, I won’t be offering my social security though haha, I just feel knowing this stuff helped me as a beginner runner. 

In May 2023, I decided I wanted to run a marathon, but knew I wanted to do it “fast” (fast is relative, I know). So I gave myself 1.5 years to train, knowing that I was going to do the Detroit Marathon in the following year. 

**Training:**

For the first year of my journey I had a coach from pretty much the start. Shout out raddadbodtv (Eric McIntre). I know I didn’t need one, but I think my team sports background wanted one. I needed structure to start and someone who I felt know their stuff, to guide me through the start, which I believe was crucial in avoiding injury and burnout. 

I started by signing up for the Baltimore Running Festival Half Marathon. My goal for this was under 2 hours. Rainy and hilly I came in at 1:54:33. Followed that up with a turkey trot a month or so later coming in at 22:39. Another 6 months after those races I did another half, DC rock n roll, coming in at 1:44:00, below my 1:45:00 goal. Around this time due to life circumstances, I dropped my coach, I simply couldn’t afford it.

Essentially 6 months out from the I was thrust on my own. I had a slow start after the second half marathon, life was lifing, combined with a grade 2 hamstring pull playing flag football (I have a history of them), next thing I new I was in the middle of summer and had no real plan in place for the race. I was running but my mileage had fallen. Around 14 weeks out from the marathon, armed with my history with my coach, some podcast, Reddit, and Matt Fitzgerald 80/20 book, I made my own plan. I probably could’ve grabbed one from the internet, but I figured why not give it a whirl. 

I had a pretty solid plan, and learned a lot. Made plenty of mistakes and created some incredibly dumb workouts but whatever. I made it, peaking at around 42mpw. My longest long run was actually only 16.5, initially was supposed to be 18 but it was a brutally hot day. I felt ready though. 

**The race:**

I actually wasn’t nervous, maybe it would’ve helped slow me down a little if I was lol. I felt really good the first half, it was tough to pace though because my watch was a whole half mile ahead of the course. Going across the ambassador bridge into Canada was a solid warm up with the elevation for sure. The tunnel was not as fun as I had hoped, a little must and warm, but whatever.

Crowd was great and the course was really flat after the tunnel, so can’t complain. Things started getting difficult around mile 15-16, my feet really started to hurt (I really like these shoes though lol), up until that point I was running off feel for the most part. Obviously was trying to hold that 8:01/mi pace, but I didn’t really feel like I was working hard for it. Around mile 21.5 I caught a cramp in my hamstring and started to get a little worried. I had to do 2-3 quick walks for them to subside and knew that if I tried to finish too strong I’d probably continue to cramp. Not sure if the cause, maybe wasn’t getting enough water through the race. Right after that there was a wonderful family handing out cups of what I thought was water or pickle juice. Bless their souls but I’ve never been so disappointed to grab it and see jelly beans in the cup lmfao. 

Caught another cramp about a mile later and knew I had a long 4-5 miles left. But I guess I asked this based on my strategy haha. I just grinded it out, mile by mile. I had to keep moving otherwise I’d forsure stall. 

Seeing family and friends along side that finish line, I’ve never been overcome with emotion like that before, not sure if it’s relief or pain or what, I didn’t even feel happy at the moment, just started crying. 

**Postmortem:**

Training was hard, but those last 12 or so miles was the hardest thing I had done mentally. Legs failing me and just kept moving them best I could. My breathing never felt labored, I just needed better legs. I know my longest run was 16.5 miles, but I wasn’t mental, I think I just need more miles through the week. 

I’m not sure what running looks like me in the future. I know I’d need to increase mileage to improve and I’m not sure that jives right now. I think I’ll focus on 5k/10k, seems more in my wheelhouse and fits my lifestyle. Maybe another marathon in some years, but I’ll relish this one before thinking about that.

I could’ve done better had I paced smarter, but I knew what could happen when I set out, I wouldn’t change a thing. 

**Additionally:**

Congrats to the couple who both took first in the men's and women’s marathons!

Condolences to the family of the gentlemen who passed away at the race.

# Training

My first ever race was last year's Berlin half marathon, where I ran a 1:47. Since then, I was running on and off, just for fun. However since this December, I decided to take my running more seriously (mainly more consistency). And so, my Half Marathon build began. 

Over the past 4 months in this half marathon build, I have been averaging between 40-50km a week.   
  
My weekly milage consisted of 1 interval session, 2 easy/recovery runs, 1 tempo session and a (not too) long run (I really struggle with concentrating on running for more than 10km, so I never actually did many long runs during my training, which I regret and will improve) 

As it turns out, until the day of the race, I didn't really know was what time I should be targeting. Initially, In December i I set out with wanting to just break 1:30, but thanks to some helpful people in this subreddit, and comparing my other times from other distances during training, I felt confident going for a sub 1:25 at least. 

# Pre-race

On the days leading up to the race, the weather in Berlin was perfect — around 20C — and my final run was  a short shakeout run on Saturday to keep the legs fresh. However the morning of the race was around 0C, which did mark a stark contrast to what I was used to

# Race

On the day of the race, Due to my time last year, I started the race in start block C, which did not have any pacers near to my goal time. And so i had to either decide if I rush forward and try to catch some 1:25 Pacers in the blocks A and B, or if i go solo.  In the end i decided that i would have to pace myself   
  
As you can see from my splits i started out pretty conservatively, being cautious not to begin too fast. The first 5k felt very easy, and i was feeling good. My mental goal during the race was to get to 10k at around 40 min and see how i felt after that. At the 10km mark, everything again felt great, I was right on time and it felt remarkably easy. From 10k i decided to push on slightly and ramp up the speed, being cautious of not overdoing it but also focusing on really getting the best out of myself. 

During the 10-15km part of this race i really focused on increasing my pace whilst keeping a reasonable heart rate, which i managed to achieve. I got to km 15 ahead of schedule and was feeling great! 

At this point i also caught up with the 1:25 pacers from the starting block before me, and this is where i believe my race to have went slightly downhill. After running with the group for about a mile, i decided that this race was mine for the taking and i could potentially get my dream/semi unrealistic goal of a sub 1:20 and so i ditched the 1:25 pacer and their group, and pushed ahead. 

At the same time, this point also marked a large out and back section during the final third of the race - this caught me completely off guard. Equally, this was all in a massive section of shade, so i began to absolutely freeze. I think a combination of the cold, my body shutting down and the mental aspect of seeing the entire out and back really took its toll on me, and so after about 2km of being ahead of the 1:25 pacer, i began to get the worst stitch ever on my right side. 

It was slowing me down immensely and at one point I had to break my number one rule - never to stop running. It felt horrible to stop but i physically couldn't anymore. After 30 seconds of my hands beginning to tingle and my head turning cold i prepared for the inevitable of me either fainting or throwing up. 

Luckily, just as i was fearing the worst, one of my friends who was roughly a 1/2 mins behind me caught up and urged me to continue. He was practically dragging me to keep going, and without him i doubt i would have. But so, with immense pain i attempted to finish the race. The 3km to go seemed impossible however with the motivation of my friend, i managed to run a decent final few kms, even though i don't remember much of it. 

I finally crossed the line with a 1:24:56 - Happy that i managed to get under the 1:25, and i now have an actual benchmark to improve on.  


# Post-race

Post Race i felt quite fine. In the days after the race my legs aren't as sore as they are after some longer runs, which makes me feel slightly disappointed that i could of potentially achieved more - however i am still happy with my time. 

I am back to training now , and am going to increase my mileage over the coming weeks to hopefully target at least 80km a week - which should be a lot more effective in training. 

Thanks for reading the story about my Berlin HM, it means a lot.

Austin, TX
February 16, 2025

Time: 2:35:47
Shoes: Nike Vaporfly 3

Goals:
- A Goal: sub 2:40
- B Goal: sub 2:45
- C Goal: safe Boston qualifier ""2:50-ish""
- D Goal: finish, even if I have to crawl

Background: 
-34M with 3 little kids.
-Located in Colorado, my normal training altitude is around 6200 ft
- Ran college cross country back in the day floating between JV and Varsity. Have spent most of the last 11 years mostly running zero to 20 miles per week. 
- I've enjoyed doing a half marathon every year to 18 months to ramp up training for a bit with a few weeks in the 30 to 40 mile range and shoot for a goal. Had a few races the last few years ranging from 1:31 to a high 1:19 four weeks out from my first marathon attempt last year 
- decided in late 2023 I wanted to try to run my first marathon in 2024. I picked one in May 2024. I trained pretty hard for about 14 weeks but failed epically come race day through an injury leading to a DNF. I got a bad calf strain around mile 3 and tried to tough it out. My leg completely gave out around mile 16 and I literally couldn't stand. 
-tried running a few times after a full month off plus PT, but still couldn't run more than 2 miles without feeling like my calf would re-injure 
- decided running was a dumb hobby and took another 5 or 6 weeks off. Busy with summer plans and the kids and enjoyed the time off
- Missed running and started throwing in a few runs per week. Had lost some fitness and remembered I love the sport. 
- huge shout out to my wife for supporting me and putting up with me being out of the house for hours every weekend on those long runs. 

Training: 
Don't want to get too boring here, but a good buddy at work who runs asked me to sign up for a trail 8k in late August. Didn't run super fast but enjoyed it. He asked me to run a trail half with him in early November. Hit a few weeks leading up of 25 to a little over 40 mpw.  Tough and slow course but I placed decently and had a blast. 

Decided the next week to try another full. I wanted to get it done before spring break so I wouldn't have to be going out for long runs every day while on vacation with my wife in kids.. They put up with that last year leading up to my race I couldn't even finish. Looked around the country and saw Austin had one in mid February. My brother lives down there so it would be an added bonus to see him and his family. 

I had built up a little base for that half and had just over 3 months to go. Hit 40 miles the next week then started working my way up to an average of 60 miles per week that I held from the second week in December through the last week in January, with a max right around 70 miles per week. I didn't follow a specific training plan, but aimed for one long run per week plus two workouts per week and 3 ""normal"" runs. I always took at least one day per week fully off. The workouts were mainly mile or half mile repeats starting at a little under 6 minute pace and working my way down to 5:30 or so pace if I felt good.  Interval workouts were on varied hilly terrain (bike paths or roads) with short jogging rest usually of 60-90 seconds. I liked these workouts in my last training cycle and felt like the shortened moving rest made me stronger than faster work on a track with stationary rest.  I also had a few tempo workouts along the way, with some 2x3-mile, 3x2-mile, and 6-7 mile total tempo sections.  Target there was usually ""around 6-minute pace"".  

Long runs started at 14 after the half, then progressed slowly up to my two longest runs of 22 miles. I live in a hilly area and made sure to get a lot of vert in my long runs since Austin is a hilly course. I would usually get 1200 to 1500 feet on these. I used several long runs as a psuedo third workout of the week if I was feeling good where I would throw in some tempo sections, work some of the longer uphills, etc.  Many of my normal runs were hilly as well.  

I had one 5k turkey trot in the November as my only other race. I decided to try a 13 mile tempo (with super shoes) in the middle of a 19 mile long run 4 weeks out from the marathon to simulate a race since there were no decent half marathons around me in January. I was able to hold right at 6 minute pace the whole tempo (flat ground this time) and felt great, essentially running a half marathon PR. This run made me revise my ""A"" goal from 2:45 down to 2:40. 

The taper was weird, with some days feeling great and some days feeling like there was no way I'd be able to finish 26 miles at any pace, much less race it. 

Race strategy:
My plan was to go out around 6:20 pace for the first 3 miles since that was some of the biggest net uphill in the whole race. If I felt good there, I planned to ""dip under"" 6 minute pace and adjust on feel from there. I figured if everything went perfectly I might be able to Crack 2:40. I decided to take one gu every 4.5 miles since that was what I'd practiced on long runs. I would drink water or electrolyte drink at every single aid station. 

Race day: 
It was chilly and windy in Austin, high 30's. I was excited about this because all of my long runs were between zero and 35 degrees outside. The wind was coming from the north, so we would start with a tail wind and turn around at 5k into a headwind on a big downhill straight. The race started at 7 AM, and my bother and parents got me to the start area around 5:50. Breakfast was a vanilla Gu plus half a bag of sour gummy worms. 

This was by far the biggest race I'd been at with around 24,000 runners between the 5k, half marathon and full marathon. I was grateful for plentiful Porta poties in the start area. They started calling people up to the start line about 30 minutes before the race and I made it up to the A corral with about 15 minutes to go. Those were some cold 15 minutes. Nick Bear gave some speech probably trying to say he doesn't do steroids. I was able to get a good starting spot in the third or fourth row of runners. 

The gun went off and I got in to race mode. The crowd and energy carried me to a 5:45 first mile.. Whoops. The next mile had more uphill and I backed off pace. Ended up a little over 6 on that one. Kept a similar effort and hit a 5:48 third mile. Effort felt good from what I I'd practiced on long runs, so I decided from here to just maintain that pace as long as I felt good. 

Came through the 10k a little over 36 minutes with the biggest into the wind section behind me. This was by far the most crowded part of the race with spectators, and the energy was incredible. There was nobody right around me for that half mile stretch, so it felt like all of the cheering was just for me. I decided there it was sub 2:40 or bust. 

Things were pretty smooth through 12 miles with rolling hills and varying degrees of wind. From 6 to 12 there had been several large pockets of spectators and cool views to keep things interesting. My Colorado hill training was really paying off, with these Texas hills feeling pretty easy. I was running in a group of 8 or so guys spaced out over 100 yards, Then we got to a point where the half marathon runners turned off, which was all but the furthest guy up I could see. We got to the halfway mark where I passed through in the mid 1:17  range, a PR. I realized if I didn't totally screw this up I would hit that sub 2:40 goal. 

Then it was like we entered the twilight zone. Suddenly we were running on a long sustained uphill, into the wind, zero spectators, and no turns in sight. The one guy I could see was 100-200 yards out front. I was still feeling decent through here but starting to get a little tired. 

We got to 15 or so miles and finally had a turn, a break from the headwind and a stretch of downhill. I was able to hold onto the pace and marched on. There started to be more spectators, but far less than the front half. 

My wife and kids were waiting and cheering for me at the 16 mile mark, which gave me a huge boost. 

At mile 18 I thought that it would be pretty great if marathons were only 20 miles, but alas, almost an hour still to go. My legs were getting more tired but I still felt decent aerobically. There was a big hill here close to the UT campus that was pretty tough. 

At 19 I calculated that I'd be around 2:42 if I dropped to 7 minute pace. I knew I had at least two more good miles and told myself let's get to 21 and go from there. 

Got some downhill from the there until a little after mile 20. It was here I remembered reading that ""20 is the real halfway point"". This turned out to be true. Most of the last 4 miles was a straight shot down Ceasar Chavez Street. The frequent turns up to this point kept the scenery, terrain, and wind fresh. Now I could see a long, long way to the downtown buildings slowly growing larger with no turn in sight. 

I took it a half mile at a time, trying to hang on to that 6 minute pace and calculating my finish time if I dropped to 7 minute miles from there. ""Let's get one more half mile then figure out the next one "".  I slowly started realizing 2:35 was a possibility. I finally got to 25 and felt my goal was close. My calves were on fire, my hips hurt, it was tough to breathe, and I wanted badly to walk. What's six more minutes?

I rounded a corner right before the 26 mile mark and saw the biggest ball buster of a hill. It wasn't too long, but very steep. I yelled out my best F Word and toughed it out. I was rewarded with a downhill boost leading to the left turn to the finish line. I saw my family cheering for me and was able to dig out a little burst through the shoot to get under 2:36. 

I couldn't believe it was over when I crossed the line.  After a heartbreaking DNF last year, I'd exceeded my highest expectation for myself. I was pumped. I found my family and gave them big hugs and probably cried a little bit. 

Thank you for reading my marathon story. I'm hooked.

### This was my first marathon. I've run two half marathons in the past and decided to take the plunge. I went with Pfitzinger 12 week up to 55mpw plan. I had to modify the schedule a bit, but never fell short of the weekly required mileage.  I actually averaged 5-10 miles more per week than the plan called for whether that was the right or wrong decision I don't know, but I felt recovered from each week. The plan called for two 20 mile runs, but I opted for an additional 21 mile run instead of the 17. I did the midweek long runs too, but there were some tempo runs that I would consider on the long side that I ended up breaking into two separate workouts for a total of running six times a week. This was mostly because I have kids and couldn't get the time to do more than 2 long runs per week. 


### The race was an hour away and I've had some bad experiences from day of packet pickups so I opted to pick up the day before which allowed me to ""sleep in"" on race day. I actually slept really well the night before, I don't know how, but it worked out. I ate an english muffin with peanut butter and a coffee. Drank 12oz Gatorade on way to the race. 


### Fueling: I trained with SiS isotonic gel. Brought 8 gels for the marathon, but only used 6 (3caff/3reg). I took the gels at 30 minute intervals, I know some have mentioned every 20 minutes, but that would have messed me up. After six I felt a bit queazy so opted to skip the last gel. They had GU Brew at the hydration stations, but I've never tried it so went with water the whole way. Also used salt stick tabs. Gear: Saucony Pro 3, Injinji toe socks (my favorite purchase and godsend after many blisters), Rabbit Speedsters, Flip Belt. Race: This was an out and back marathon. Miles 1-14: I would consider this a smaller race with only 800 participants, 180 in the marathon. Race went out in waves with the marathon first. They grouped us in target times and the gun went off. Immediately the whole front of the pack were out with the lone guy targeting a sub 2:20 time. After about a minute I looked at my watch and dialed it way back. My plan going into this race was to bank early milage below marathon pace and gut out the finish so I settled on a 7:30ish pace early on. I found a guy in the local runners club and ended up chatting with him for the first 4 miles or so to avoid getting caught up going to fast again. In the taper week leading up to the marathon I did something to the tendon on the front of my ankle and rested it the best I could, but knew it would flair up on race day and it did at mile 6. I pushed through and it ended up subsiding or I just forgot about it by the half marathon point. Miles 14-17: This was billed to me as a flat course, but that was not the case. There was a 2.5 to 3 mile continuous up hill climb. With it being an out and back I knew this was coming and planned to dial back my splits to conserve energy, ended up running those 3 miles at 7:50 which was still below my target marathon pace. 17-26: after the long hill I settled in to a slower pace going over 8:00 for the first time in the race, I did my best to keep it close to marathon pace for as long as I could, but the wheels started to come off at mile 24 in which I ran a 9:09! This was the hardest mile I have ever run in my life. I trained without music, but brought headphones as a motivational boost for the tail end of the race, but of course they crapped out and I was left with my thoughts. As I passed fellow marathoners walking down the stretch I wasn't sure I could do this and questioned my choices, but was able to finish out the race in the end. 


### This was the best part of the race. It was awesome to have family cheering for me at the finish line and a moment I will cherish for all time. I don't normally drink, but the race purchase came with a free tech shirt and beer so I said what the heck. Definitely the best beer I ever had! I already know that I want to try this marathon thing again in the future. Definitely made some mistakes I can improve upon and want to pick a more destination type marathon, but overall I am over the moon with my results. A huge thank you to this community for the amazing tips and tricks you have shared with me. Thanks for reading.

* Half-marathon: 1:25:49 (2019)

**Training/Context**

For a while, I've been wanting to beat the mile personal best of 4:57 that I set in December 2016 at the age of 24. Paranoid about getting older and wanted to prove to myself that I can still set PRs, and I figure that the shorter-distance speed is probably the first to go. I also play men's league basketball twice a week, which, while not professional or anything, is fairly intense/demanding.

I originally wanted to set the new mile PR earlier, but didn't get there due to some slightly misguided training and then seasonal challenges of winter (snow/ice challenges, did some traveling and skiing over the winter that fragmented training a little bit).

At the beginning of April, I was in low-5 shape, but really wanted to put this behind me, so I found a couple of upcoming open track races to structure around: A 1500m race on May 18, and a mile race on June 1. I committed to a consistent 6-week build up to the 1500m race and then two weeks of sharpening for the mile. 

**Key Adjustments** - I alluded to 'misguided training' earlier, and in that vein, there are two training adjustments I made that I think really helped me out:

* Limiting hard days / 1 hard running workout per week - Previously, I tried to do two hard running workouts per week in addition to my two intense basketball days. I was able to handle this when I was 24, but it took a while to recognize that at 31, this was leaving my legs feeling constantly dead and slow. So I adjusted to 1 hard running workout per week, replacing the other workout with an easy run and giving myself generally more recovery.

* More and slower volume - This goes hand-in-hand with the prior point, but in addition to doing two workouts per week, I was overly focused on race-pace workouts every time. And besides making my legs tired, it also limited my overall volume, which in turn limited my fitness. In this 6-week build, the additional easy run helped increase my overall mileage, though I still only peaked around 26-27 mpw. And for my one main workout per week, I did longer workouts with some slower paces. As an example, a key workout was: alternating 400m at race pace and 1k at 5k pace, completing 5x400 (mile pace) and 4x1k (5k pace). I also sprinkled in some 200s at faster than race space just to stay confident in my leg speed.

**1500m race, May 18** - I was a bit nervous about this, as I hadn't done longer race-pace intervals beyond 400m, but decided to trust my adjustments. Equivalent 1500m for my mile goal would be about 4:38, so I figured if I could work with 4:40 or lower. Ended up running 4:34, which equates to a 4:52-4:53 mile, so I was quite pleased.

I did a couple speed-based workouts in the following week with less volume, including an 800 at 2:25 along with faster-than-race 200m reps; and then 4x400 with 3-4 minutes rest, all sub-70 seconds and progressively faster (finished the last rep in 64.5). That gave me confidence that my speed was in a good place.

**Mile Race, June 1**

Bit of a hotter day than I would've liked, at just under 80F and sunny at race time, but thankfully not too humid. There were 16 people in my heat, so the first lap involved some navigating and running in lane 2 for a while, but came in at 73 seconds, which was solid (especially considering there's an extra 9 meters in that first lap, which is worth about a second). Hit the next two laps at just about 73-even, coming in at 2:26 and 3:49-ish. Final lap, pushed hard, passed some people fading and thought I snuck in at 4:50.xx, but official time had me at 4:51.10, putting me at about 72 seconds for the final lap. 

Ultimately, very pleased with surpassing my goal, although now I wonder if I could've gotten 4:49 with a slightly better race! Also feel pretty happy knowing that most of the people I raced against were younger, lighter, and most were part of some club that had a little more coaching/guidance than I had by myself. 

**TL;DR**: Ran 4:51 mile - after some training struggles, key adjustments were limiting my hard days and allowing myself to incorporate some longer workouts with slower than race pace reps."

I ran my first marathon on Sunday after following a Runner's World sub-4 hour plan for 12 weeks + many months of regular runs / base building. 

Very happy to report I ran 3:50:01 at an 8:46 pace! (36F)

I have some questions about how I could do better next time.

(For context, I'm a lifelong distance runner, but the marathon is just a whole different beast and I have a lot to learn.)

* I pulled my calf (really, my whole hamstring) 10 days out from the race. In hindsight it was probably a blessing, because I was off my feet for 10 days heating, stretching, foam rolling, etc. religiously leading up to race day. Unfortunately both my hamstrings started to seize up after Mile 8, and I had to significantly change my gait to prevent it from getting worse. (Really concentrating on heel striking and moving through dorsiflexion.) I was also surprised to see so many runners dropping out, grabbing their hamstrings in pain, apparently suffering from the same thing that happened to me. What are we all doing wrong? I did experience general tightness during my training block. Should I have been stretching after every single run? Should I have been doing more calf and hamstring-specific strength training? (For context, I also have had arch pain / plantar fasciitis for a year or two, which I've been told is related.)
* I got a HORRIBLE side stitch around Mile 15 when I was planning to take my third gel. I opted against it because I was worried the gels contributed. Then after Mile 18 I stopped taking water/gatorade at the hydration stations because I was worried water belly might be the problem. By Mile 20, I got a side stitch on the OTHER side. Finally at Mile 22, I stopped and walked for maybe 15 seconds, and the side stitches basically resolved. Should I have just stopped and walked for a bit earlier? I've never struggled with side stitches at shorter distances!
* What's the secret to toeing the line between adding more distance and avoiding overtraining/injury? By Week 9 of my plan, my period was severely delayed (like almost half a month) and I started worrying about the ""female athlete triad"". At the very beginning of my training, I did lose about 10 pounds (maybe entirely because I decided to stop drinking alcohol during my training block), but I did gain most of it back eventually as I figured out how to fuel properly. I did a 2x week strength training program that I discontinued around Week 8 because I was feeling really low energy. I sometimes ran my ""easy"" runs a bit faster than advised simply because I felt good and wasn't paying attention to my phone til I finished and stopped my Strava (like instead of a 7 mile run at 9min mile pace, I'd run at like 8:15 pace). What else could I be doing better to mitigate injury/overtraining? 
* My Strava/Fitbit (an old Inspire 3 model) really did a poor job of tracking my mileage/pace during the run. (I was also in a city where GPS just generally has more trouble operating accurately.) I'm thinking about getting a new running watch with better accuracy and battery life, and preferably some smart(ish) features like a vibrating alarm, a period tracker, a connection to my phone so it will vibrate when I get calls, etc. Any recommendations?

I'm open to any and all critiques! I know it's impossible to really isolate variables and understand what caused what / reflect on what I could have done better, but I appreciate any and all ideas from those who've been there."

# Pre-Training

Male, late 20's. Hadn't participated in formal running since middle school. My running for the last few years consisted solely of occasional way-too-high-intensity 5k and 10k's. Never more than 20k in a week. On average, probably less than 10k per week.

I had a friend sign up for a marathon, and decided it was to finally get more serious.

# Training

First Marathon. Followed a random internet plan for \~4w, then read the Pfitz Advanced Marathoning book and -in hindsight, foolishly- switched into a Pfitz 12/55 (going from 25 to 40 miles per week). I followed this plan closely, but did come across a few small injuries. Luckily, these never forced me to skip more than 1 run at a time. I'll be the first to admit: I ramped up too fast, and am lucky to have positive result from this training cycle.

I set ambitious goals, and felt I had to ""prove to myself"" along the training plan that they were realistic. From a 16w training plan, I hit a few time trials:

* 8w in: 10k in 37:50
* 11w in: HM in 1:20:XX
* 13w in: 10k in 36:40

The HM and second 10k gave me confidence that a 2:55 should be possible.

# Pre-race

Aimed for 500 grams of carbs Friday, 700 grams of carbs Saturday. I don't have many secrets here. Lots of bagels, a huge enjoyable pancake breakfast on Saturday, gatorades and smoothies (probably drank 1/3 of my carbs).

# Race

Was very scared of the prophesied ""wall"". Planned to stay with the 2:55 pacer until mile 17, check how I felt, then take off. We had an awesome pacer, and he actually gave some in-race coaching to hold off a little longer until 20. Half way through mile 20, I finally took off. I wasn't paying attention to time anymore, just going for a ""sustainable push"".

# For those looking for course details

The ""hills"" on this course are minimal. I read posts about a difficult hill in mile 8, but in the race it felt mild and short. Assuming you're not doing all of your running with < 10 ft of elevation gain (i.e. you occasionally run up a single hill during runs), I don't think this course requires any special training!

# Post-race

Very happy with the result! 

If I am trying to be my own coach, I likely had too much left for those last 5 miles, and could have run faster earlier. That said, I don't think I would if I could go back! I actually was really able to enjoy those first 20 and take in the views. If my cardio-feeling in the last 4 miles was instead over the last 13 miles, I would not have enjoyed this nearly has much.

... that said, if I end up missing the 2026 Boston adjustments by 15 seconds, I might think differently :)

I read hundreds of posts in this community for the last 3-4 months, thank you all for making this such an informational sub!

Plus, some reflections on running and parenting","Before I risk getting pilloried in r/RunningCirclejerk, I'll state up front that this isn't the post for you if you're looking for advice on hitting time goals, key workouts for half marathon performance, shoe reviews, etc. I am one of the slowest regulars in AR. That said, you may be interested if you:

1. like reports on unusual race experiences
2. want to hear diverse perspectives (from the last member survey, I think only \~15% of Advanced Running members are female)
3. are an expectant parent or new-ish parent thinking about how to successfully train with kids
4. are generally wondering how to expand your attitude towards running in order to derive enjoyment outside of performance, and/or stay advanced without singular pursuit of PRs
5. Or, you're just sitting on the toilet and looking for a long read while you poop.

TL;DR Long-time athlete finding challenge and fun in stroller running. Some advice, some race reporting, some cute kid moments, and one Jesus impersonator.

# With That Out of the Way, a Preamble

The more experience I gain as an athlete (19 years of running, 75+ races and counting!), the more I value consistency. It's probably the #1 piece of advice you'll get from the pros, and from this sub. Since 2008, I can count on one hand the number of times I've taken more than a month off of running- namely, pregnancy/postpartum with my kids and a couple non-running injuries. Since becoming a parent, the linchpin to maintaining consistency has been stroller running.

Juggling running and parenting has been a regular topic of discussion here, namely: how do you keep up with advanced running once kids enter the picture? This is especially challenging for runners who are driven by performance. It's undeniably thrilling to set ambitious goals and work hard to achieve them! But if you want to remain consistent, there are times when you'll have to adapt or step back. In those times, it's helpful to remember the sub's sidebar (“Advanced running: it's a mindset”) and reframe. I define advanced running not by time or mileage, but by the following three characteristics:

1. Thoughtfully setting running goals
2. Working towards those goals with the time and energy appropriate for your life
3. Evaluating your success in achieving those goals, reflecting and adjusting as needed

If you broaden your definition of advanced running beyond performance, then you can bring that dedicated, focused mindset to the sport even when you are constrained by a busy job, young children (or older kids who need you to drive them everywhere), caring for other family, injury, or plain old burnout.

I went through this mindset shift last year, once I worked through postpartum healing and returned to unrestricted exercise after my second kid. I had concluded two distinct phases of my athletic life before this: first, training 10 hours a week for a half Ironman triathlon; followed by exercising with minimal structure for years during the thick of childbearing (including a miscarriage) and Covid. Returning to committed training with two children would mean a new phase-- one in which my kids are an integral part of my athletics. My husband is not a jock, so we can't trade training time. Even if he did watch the kids while I ran, his big hobby is video gaming-- so I can't reciprocate unless I get the little ones out of the house and away from the irresistible lure of things flashing on a screen. My work schedule is busy enough that I can't reliably count on lunch break training time, and frequent pre-dawn running would leave me and my whole family ragged- especially since I'm still breastfeeding.

(A side note on moms having time to exercise: I've noticed, both in real life and here in Advanced Running, that the moms doing higher-mileage training predominantly: a. have an athletic spouse who supports them, and/or b. don't work full-time. That's clearly not the case for dads. Why do you think that is? Research shows that women have less leisure time than men and spend less time exercising overall. \[[Gift link to an article on this here](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/11/well/move/exercise-gender-gap-caregiving.html?unlocked_article_code=1.gk4.BKJs.hZeB5uM_Lxdr&smid=url-share)\] I encourage the straight men of the sub to reflect on this... the ways that women actively choose to step back from training, and the ways that their partners' behavior contributes to that decision. If you're partnered, check in with your wife/girlfriend about her ability to pursue her own hobbies. Especially if you have kids!)

So integrating my children into exercise, as I mentioned up top, is how I make training work. But it's not a sacrifice in order to maintain consistency. Stroller running is intrinsically excellent and rewarding as an athlete and a parent! Here's a non-exhaustive list why:

1. More sleep. You can run with the kids before school at 7:30 AM instead of before everyone wakes up at 5:30 AM.
2. A happier partner. Your spouse gets time at home alone, instead of feeling harried watching the kids for your leisure. Your hobby fills both your cups.
3. Modeling fitness. There's the obvious way-- your kids literally see you exercise. But you model it in subtler ways, too. They observe how you prioritize fitness. And they see that exercise is enjoyable. If training is at the margins of your family life, what do they see besides you muttering at your Garmin or groaning over the foam roller?
4. Core strength. Your whole trunk has to be even more stable when stroller running-- especially when going from a single to double. Core work and strength training become non-negotiable in your routine, which benefits every aspect of running and day to day life.
5. FUN! This is the most important of all. Bringing the kids into my training has become the catalyst for countless adventures, big and small. We've run in all five boroughs of NYC, where we live. We've met pet parrots and pythons by running past their eccentric owners. We run to the beach and dip our toes in the waves afterwards, or make playground pit stops to monkey around on the jungle gym. I blast the Moana soundtrack during speed workouts, or we pretend to outrun the wildebeests in Lion King. Beyond where we go or what we do, it's one of my only opportunities to hear what's on their minds in an environment not mediated by toys, screens, or other external influences. Out on a run, my toddler daughter practices babbling and animal sounds, while my kindergartener son and I ponder questions like, ""Does a narwhal need toothpaste?,"" ""Is there a running stroller big enough to hold all of New York City?,” or ""What if an ostrich had a BUTT on its HEAD?"" (As anyone who has been around young boys, or been a young boy, can guess.... these discussions are increasingly scatological in nature.)

In short, the double stroller era has been one of the most rewarding phases of my 19-year running career, ranking up there with my PR seasons. I couldn't have guessed how much I could achieve athletically or as a parent when I bought my double Bob off Facebook Marketplace. You may be pleasantly surprised too! Used running strollers are often available online and a great way to try things out with your kid(s). I encourage every running parent to consider how more stroller miles could fit in their life. And if the weather is too harsh these days, or if your baby is too young for a running stroller-- save this post and think about it again in a few months.

And now, here's the race report on 13.1 of the hundreds of stroller miles we ran in 2024.

# Background

I did my first double stroller half marathon in 2023, when my daughter was 11 months old and barely sleeping through the night. At the time, I decided the risks of very low mileage (average 15 mpw) were acceptable because there was no way I could run more without decreasing sleep or increasing stress. The 2023 race was a big success! Unsurprisingly, I came away with a couple of niggles that needed PT. The first half of 2024 was devoted to building even more strength and addressing those niggles. That came out to 2 runs per week, plus 3 weekly sessions of PT/kettlebell training/indoor cycling/etc.

I planned my process-oriented and outcome-oriented goals for the rest of the year once I felt confident in running more and making concrete plans. Setting process-oriented goals is a common tactic that's enormously useful for anyone with external life demands. If something goes awry on race day (work stress during race week, sick kid, etc) you can zoom out to your accomplishments over the course of the season.

I outlined my goals for this training block in the [summer/fall ladies thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/1ec8577/comment/lf145mr/):

Process: Build up mileage without getting hurt, maintain 1-2 strength sessions per week even while adding more runs, and optimize nutrition and routes for long run success.

Outcome: Run the double stroller half faster than last year, achieve one strength standard for [Strongfirst SFG1 kettlebell coach certification](https://www.strongfirst.com/certifications/sfg-i-requirements/) (as a benchmark-- not trying to become a gym rat).... and watch a lot of Olympic track and field!

# Training

From June-August I built up mileage, then trained from Aug-Oct at 20-25 mpw. My mileage wasn't high enough to merit cut back weeks; other than a bout of Covid in August, I had no illnesses or injuries that forced me to rest until race week. (Yes! It's possible to have daycare kids who don't get you sick all the time!) I didn't follow a specific plan, and structured my training around the fundamentals in order to have sufficient flexibility.

Those fundamentals consisted of 4 runs and 1-2 strength sessions per week. The weekly runs included a long run and a workout, both with the double stroller, and two easy runs (75% with the stroller, the rest solo). Workouts were a mix of 400m repeats, tempo runs, and fartleks, depending on our timing and what the kids felt like doing. I ran them based on RPE, since that's a far simpler solution than converting stroller paces, accounting for wind and hills, etc. Easy runs were often a part of school dropoff or pickup, and typically included a playground visit when time and weather allowed. I worked in a lot more playground strength sessions when my daughter was a baby; now that she wants to play too, I only do playground strength when we visit a space with stumps, pullup bars, or other exercise equipment for adults. Otherwise, strength work usually took place while the kids watched Bluey.

In terms of stroller logistics-- my children are pretty easygoing by nature, which contributes to our success in hour-plus running stroller outings. Their enjoyment of the experience is facilitated by: 1. brokering playground access (“Mommy's going to run PAST the playground first, then we'll finish and play there”), 2. structuring long runs around adventures, and 3. Snacks, snacks, even more snacks, and adequate hydration. We don't do screen-based entertainment in the stroller. Music is reserved for workouts when I'm running too hard to chat with them. Some parents have success with a Yoto Player or similar device if kids need more stimulation. My kids definitely whine sometimes-- and my son went through a stroller tantrum phase at age 2-- but they generally settle in and appreciate the experience too. As for other factors in our stroller running success, I'd be remiss not to mention city planning advantages-- namely, that all roads have sidewalks, which is not the case for everyone.

I achieved my process goals from summer through fall. Between babies and triathlon training, it had been years since I ran 4x/week. It felt good! Nutrition left something to be desired, but that's because I have Type 1 diabetes and have to strictly manage my blood sugar on top of everything else I'm juggling in life. Drop a comment if you're also T1D-- I always like connecting with diabetic athletes.

Unfortunately diabetes threw me a loop days before the race! In a low blood sugar moment, I fished out some grapes that had been in my son's lunchbox all day. That was a gamble with food-borne illness that I decisively lost at 5 AM the next morning. After puking my guts out and eating plain rice for a while, my stomach righted itself only the day before the race.

# Race

Murphy's law of running parents says that if you're with your family the night before a big race, your kids will have a crap night of sleep and wake you up. Sure enough, my daughter (age 1 on race day, turned 2 shortly afterwards) woke up wailing at midnight and had to sleep with me. At least this made rousing her before 6 AM marginally easier. Astoundingly, I woke my son (age 5) with little fuss, fed everyone, and got ourselves out the door only 15 minutes behind schedule. My husband finds cheering for races about as enjoyable as a root canal, and I wouldn't make other family or friends travel to the farthest outskirts of New York City for this, so I handled both kids and all logistics by myself for the day.

For anyone in the NYC Metro area looking to exit the NYRR rat race, make the schlep to the Rockaways! Rockaway Track Club races are eminently relaxed. Shirts, medals, and bibs are the same for each race; a guy with a megaphone calls runners to the start, and post-race festivities consist of a box of Frito-Lay snack packs and hanging around with volunteers who are lifetime Long Islanders. This organization is so chill that they were the only one I could find who permitted strollers in races. Most other race organizers forbid them for insurance/liability purposes. The races themselves are loops on the Rockaway Beach boardwalk. Flat and generally straight, well-suited for a stroller, and only a boring course if you don't like looking at the ocean or admiring boardwalk characters.

I suppose I was one of those characters for other racers, with my 30-inch wide stroller. Lots of people smiled or shared a word of encouragement (“Good job, Mom!”) as we passed each other on loops, especially in the early miles when we were more bunched together. Among some of the people I chatted with during the race were: a guy dressed like Jesus; a guy from the UK running his second full marathon who told me he was 2 for 2 on mid-race Jesus sightings; a young woman running her first half ever; a middle aged woman running her first race in over a decade; an older guy with one arm, and one-arm guy's two-arm buddy, who exclaimed that this was their 73rd race together.

After stopping to massage a tight calf in mile 3, I could relax into a rhythm (of not only running, but also smiling/waving to the nice folks cheering for us and responding to my son's fart jokes). The kids both dozed off around mile 5, and in those quiet middle miles I leaned on mental skills training to stay focused and keep working at race pace. One interesting difference between solo training and stroller running is the type of mental skills they develop. Running with just yourself (or a group of other adults) pushes you to narrow your focus and commit to running a certain effort level. Stroller runs sharpen your mental skills because you must maintain effort while simultaneously engaging with your child/children and monitoring their needs. It's reminiscent of Alex Hutchinson and his writing on brain training/cognitive fatigue, though I understand the evidence itself is mixed.

All of this is to say that I had the chance to work hard and focus on myself, and then when the kids woke up, I had the chance to work hard while also giving them snacks and Gatorade. My diabetes management was excellent, all things considered, but I had to adjust my insulin/fuel calculations on the fly when I discovered that the organizers had advertised Gatorade at the race but were instead supplying runners with Gatorade Zero. Sadly my post-illness GI tract was not so excellent from miles 8-10.... but I could park the kids on the boardwalk and duck into one of the open bathrooms. That pit stop cost me the chance to run <2:30, but I only feel salty about that until I remember that *no one except me cares.*

From bathroom break on, I booked it to at least achieve a negative split. Race day was windy, which of course makes stroller runs a little spicier. I got a tailwind for about 2-3 miles of the course, but beyond that we were buffeted by moderate cross winds. I tried to turn this into a teachable moment about cheering for people and encouragement. My son offered one spirited ""I believe in you! You can do it!"", which truly boosted my morale, before asking when we could go to the playground, which did not. My daughter, being the consummate toddler, looked around quietly until mile 12.5 when she started wailing about needing to remove her shoes and socks. I stopped to relieve her of her footwear and then raced to the finish. The race wound up being 9 minutes faster than last year, with a 1-minute negative split!

# Post-Race

My children were enthralled by their very own medals, and then got even more excited when I gave them the whole bag of my post-race Doritos. We went to a boardwalk playground straight away, where climbing on the equipment with them really helped me stretch and stay limber. After lunch together, we hit the beach so I could partake in nature's ice bath (up to my calves, anyways) and the kids could watch surfers and seagulls. I sat on the beach, medal around my neck while the kids buried my feet in the sand, and every cell in my body-- even the sore ones-- radiated with happiness.

A whole lot of life happened in November-December, for better (daughter's birthday!) or for worse (I work in US public health and we're prepping for a whole new round of nightmares with the 47th administration). In the midst of it, I ran my B race of the season: a hilly 10-miler without kids. I set a time goal that felt like an honest, not all-out effort and cleared it with a minute to spare. Once equalizing for course difficulty, the pace differential came out to my previous experience, over both workouts and easy runs: I usually go 10-15% slower with a single stroller, and 15-20% slower with a double stroller. Curious to hear if this matches others' experiences!

Edited to add: I also hit my strength-focused outcome goal in December, and could regularly do 10 one-handed kettlebell swings with 16 kilogram bells (equivalent to 24 kg for most men here). Strongfirst is a good resource for functional, challenging strength programming if you also have a home gym setup.

I can't do 3-4 stroller runs per week in the winter, but at a minimum we're going out for weekend runs together. I think I can eke out one more double stroller season before my son gets too big for it. I'll mourn the day he does! Sharing all this joy and accomplishment with both kids is a blessing. I can only hope it inspires them to love running too.

Given my preparation I ran a very bad time (chip time 4:13:22), but still I was still very happy to reach the finish line.

**Background**

Last August, a friend and I decided we would challenge ourselves to run a marathon together. For me, initially the main goal was to have something to train for to get back in to shape. 

I was never much of an athlete. In middle and high school I did cross-country running and swimming but never made the team. I got into shape at university: I was a gym rat, into extreme calisthenics (I could do the human flag at one point), and did some running ""for cardio"". Then life happened: got a job, got married, got a dog, got kids. When life is busy it's very easy to let fitness take a back seat. I had episodes where I tried to pick up running again or going to the gym. I lacked planning and consistency.  

My second daughter was born in March 2024; by then I was almost completely sedentary and probably in the worst shape of my life. At that time I weighed \~80 kg. Not super overweight and I could always jog out a 5K, but most days I had very little energy. 

In the spring of 2024, I picked up running again but in July I got a very bad calf strain and had to rest for a few weeks. 

That brings us to August 2024, when we decided we would start training for the marathon. At that time we did not decide which one, but we gave ourselves \~6 months.

**Preparation**

I basically googled: how to run a marathon in 6 months and ended up on this plan: [https://marathonhandbook.com/how-to-train-for-a-marathon-in-6-months/](https://marathonhandbook.com/how-to-train-for-a-marathon-in-6-months/) . I started right away at the end of August. The first few weeks I followed it religiously, but with family and work I quickly had to adjust to be more flexible and just aimed to roughly hit the total weekly distance. In the beginning pretty much only did ""moderate pace"" runs at a \~5:30 min/km pace with heart rate always in the Garmin threshold range (155-165). Later I learned I should have perhaps run slower, but I was going off of my RPE feeling. As my aerobic base built up, the 5:40-5:30 min/km pace became my default training tempo with HR typically between 140-145, solidly in the aerobic range. 

In October 2024 I signed up for my first race: a 17 km trail run near my house. I made all the mistakes: went out way too hard at 5:00 min/km pace trying to follow another runner, and consumed no water or fuel. Hit a wall with 4 km to go, finished the race at a pace of 6:30 min/km. Averaged 5:30 min/km pace over the entire race.

Later that month I had also signed up for a half marathon, also a trail run. Most of the course was flat, running through fields, except for some nasty hills in the last 5k. Thought I would go for a pace of 5:30 min/km, but managed to finish in 1h50 with an average pace of \~5:10 min/km.

Did another 33 km trail run in November, a bit early in the preparation, but also managed a 5:20 min/km pace. Cardio-wise it felt OK, but at that time my legs were not yet used to this distance.

In January 2025 my friend and I finally decided to sign up for the Brussels-Leuven marathon in April. My friend started his training that month. I was already at a pretty good level, so I started working speed into the runs and improving my PRs. Managed to work down the 5K to 20:37, 10K to 45:24, and the HM to 1:40:12. Also did some longer runs at faster paces, like a 38 K run at 5:20 min/km pace and a 30K run at 4:59 min/km pace. At this point I was no longer following any strict plan, just going for 60-80 km/week, pretty confident in a sub 4 marathon if not a 3:30. In retrospect I got too cocky because it was going too well. Built up volume too fast and did too much speed.

**Set-backs**

At the end of February I felt serious pain in the groin after a session with tempo blocks. The onset was gradual but by the end of the session I was limping. The verdict: adductor tendinopathy, an overuse injury. Went from 80 to 0 km/week, as even walking or putting on pants was painful. 

Middle of March I had signed up for another half marathon race to test the pace for the marathon in April. The week before I started running again, very slowly (\~6:00 min/km pace). There was a slight pain but it felt manageable. Two days before the HM I decided to go for a slightly faster run (\~5:15 min/km) but after 6 km I felt something rip in my calf. Stopped running immediately. Minor calf strain, probably a compensation injury.

With painful adductor tendons and a strained calf I still stupidly decided to run the HM. Basically limped it in 2 hours and 7 min, my worst time ever. Each step was painful. Luckily, the next day I was fine and it seems I miraculously didn't make things worse.

One month to the marathon race, I started up physical therapy and tried to save what could be saved with cross training. Luckily swimming and cycling were not painful. I did two sessions of swimming 2 km per week and two sessions of cycling on a stationary bike for 1 hour at 190 W. My ambition for the marathon had gone from a 3:30 finish to making it to the start line.

Very gradually I worked in some slow test runs again and swore off any speed until the race. Two weeks before the race I ran my last long run of 22 km at 5:40 min/km pace, entirely in the aerobic HR regime. It was mostly painless, which gave me confidence I would at least participate in the marathon.

**Pre-race week**

Here I went back to the original plan, doing a one week taper with two very slow 5 k runs to keep things loose. Not sure whether a taper was necessary as I wasn't doing that much running the weeks before. I didn't do anything special regarding nutrition. I ate pasta the day before.

**Race day**

The night before the race I could not sleep, probably from stress/nerves. My resting heart rate is normally \~45-50 BPM when I sleep, this night it didn't drop below 65. To make things worse, my youngest daughter was sick and puked in her bed 3 times between 1 and 3 a.m. which I helped clean up. I had to be out the door at 6:30 to make it to Brussels. I was extremely tired and unfit; legs felt weak, resting heart rate was 20-30 BPM higher than usual. Garmin ""body battery"" was at 30. The prospect of running 42 km in this condition was not appealing. Like every morning I ate a bowl of oatmeal + an extra banana. I ate another banana and a cookie \~40 min before the start. I drank a lot of water to ensure I would at least not start dehydrated.

My friend and I made it to the start in time and went into the <3:59 box. My friend was prepared for a sub 4 finish, so we decided to run together. However, he also had a terrible night. The plan was to run based on heart rate in the first half and stick to the aerobic zone, hopefully at a 5:40-5:30 min/km pace, then pick up the pace in the second half. Conditions were mostly dry/very mild rain, cloudy, \~15 degrees Celcius, so almost perfect for running. However, it was also quite humid in the city, which made it feel uncomfortably warm. But, like a wise man once said: everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. When I set up my Garmin for the run, it recommended a 15 min recovery run at a 6:35 min/km pace. Oops.

**The race**

I tried to stick to the 5:40 plan but my friend immediately barged ahead at 5:20, so I tried to follow at 5:30. He eventually slowed down and I caught up with him after 2 km. The plan was not going well. We were both already in the threshold HR regime (\~160 for me). The first few km was going down and up through tunnels. The air in the tunnels was humid and hot. The up-and-down + heat right in the beginning were terrible for managing energy levels, which you can see in the erratic pace behavior the first few km. We had to slow down, eventually settling on a pace \~6:00 min/km, and I eventually managed to get my HR back into the upper range of the green zone. Most of the first 10k was uphill. Our pace was slipping, even when going downhill, and after 15k it was clear a sub 4 was becoming impossible. 

The first 4 aid stations only had water and isotonic drink, nothing to eat. I had only brought one gel, thinking I'd be OK with the bananas and candies that would be provided. This brought on difficulties for me later in the race.

At 20k, the first 4:15 pacer passed us and I decided I would try to follow. My friend already started cramping in his hamstrings and fell further and further behind. I stopped looking at HR entirely and tried to focus on just following the pacer. However, at km 25-26 I suddenly got a feeling of becoming unwell, a shiver down my spine and the feeling of the legs becoming wet noodles. I was going to pass out. I check heart rate, it's at 180 BPM deep in red. I think a blood sugar crash, perhaps also some dehydration. I let the pacer go and slowed down substantially until the next aid station. There I walked a bit, had a lot to drink, stuffed my face with candy and banana, and let heart rate recover to \~140. Then continued on my own, keeping track of HR trying to stay under 170, forgetting about the pacer. My main focus was to get to the next aid station, where I did the same thing: walked a bit, drank a lot and let HR recover. 

Around km 30, another 4:15 pacer passed and I stuck with this one until km 39. The aid stations were more closely spaced, and I made full use to drink and eat as much as my stomach could tolerate. 

For the last 3 km I decided: fuck it, and went all out. Left the pacer behind, passed the first pacer I had followed, and even managed to ""sprint"" the last 800 m. Heart was exploding in my chest. Hit my max heart rate of 192 BPM at one point. But despite the set-backs and injuries, I made it across the finish in position 5767 out of 9454 finishers and 9720 participants.

My friend also finished in 4:45. The last 8 km he had been severely cramping in his legs and basically just hobbled.

The marathon definitely punched both of us in the face. We learned later that most people who ran this race did significantly worse than expected; it was a tough hilly course.

**Post-race**

Legs were surprisingly fresh post race, probably because I ran at a pretty slow pace overall. We had a shower, then Korean BBQ and ice cream. I lost 3 kg between the start and end of the race. I did not anticipate the pain in the shoulders/traps + headache from bouncing up and down for 4 hours. 

Again I did not have the best night after the marathon and RHR is still up substantially (70-80 BPM). I intend to take a full week of rest now.

**Learnings and reflections**

* Don't be stupid and impatient. Build up volume and speed slowly to allow your body to adapt.
* Race day nerves are legit
* Bad sleep = bad performance
* Bring your own food/gels just in case
* Drink more in the beginning
* Train more on hills or choose a flat marathon (I live in a very flat part of the country)
* 42 km != 2 x 21 km
* I prefer calm trail runs over busy road races

**Future plans**

I'd like to do one max two marathons per year to keep me motivated to stay in shape / keep a good baseline of fitness. Right now I'm hoping to build back up very slowly to 50-60 km/week and then follow a proper plan (I've got Higdon's book) when a marathon is coming up. I didn't do much cross-training in the beginning but now I'm thinking to maybe go swimming and/or cycling once a week. In terms of times, I'd like to at some point break 20 min on 5 k, 40 min on 10 k, 1:30 on HM and the holy grail 3:00 on the marathon. Pretty sure chasing these can keep me busy for years to come.

Thanks to this community for all the tips and support, and thanks for reading!"

# Training (Pfitzinger 18/105)

* **Duration:** 18 weeks
* **Average Mileage:** \~90 mpw
* **Peak Mileage:** \~105 mpw (Included four consecutive 100+ mile weeks due to shifting a recovery week)
* **Total Mileage:** 1616 miles (vs. 1611 planned)
* **Key Features:** Trained at \~5000ft altitude. Half on hills. Half on treadmill. Maintained prescribed workout paces but ran recovery runs very slow (\~11-13 min/mile), mostly due to extreme soreness from increased mileage. Included 3x/week full-body weightlifting. Squats were my only lower-body. Average pace was \~9:30.
* **Calf Soreness:** Developed left calf soreness post-tune-up race, which persisted. I did not shorten any runs, and most runs were still run at prescribed paces. Calf soreness usually went away after 2-3 miles of running fast/hard.
* **Low-Sodium Diet:** Around the same time as the calf soreness, I briefly adopted a very-low-sodium diet. This was under medical advice for sudden hearing loss. After a few weeks, we determined that it was actually a viral infection, and I resumed normal sodium intake.

# Tune-up Race

* **Race:** Sun Marathon Half (St. George, UT), Jan 24, 2025
* **Result:** 1:19:03 (1st Overall)
* **Notes:** Provided confidence, though VDOT (\~2:45) may have been optimistic given course differences. Calf soreness began shortly after this race.

# Race Day

**Conditions:** Anticipated heat/humidity; used an ice pouch around the neck for the first half. For images of ice pouch, see:

[https://www.flickr.com/gp/wilcoxes/yV3527Tu84](https://www.flickr.com/gp/wilcoxes/yV3527Tu84)

**Pacing:** Aimed for even splits (\~6:17/mile for 2:45) but started faster (\~6:06-6:12) as initial miles felt easy.

**Outcome:** Maintained sub-6:20 pace through mile 13, but slowed significantly in the second half as heat increased and ice depleted after the half. Experienced a positive split, finishing with miles ranging from \~6:30 to \~7:00.

**Result:** Achieved Goal B (<2:50) and Goal C (PR by \~1:50). Placed 6th (non-elite) out of \~930. The placing is **much** better than I've ever done previously.

   * *(Note the positive split pattern after mile 12)*

# Post-Race

The pre-existing calf soreness worsened significantly during the race, diagnosed post-race as a soleus strain. Walking was difficult for the following week.

Recovery has been very slow and somewhat cautious. I'm running every other day, walking \~12mi on non-running days and cross-training with a rower and indoor bike. I also modified my strength routine to focus on hinges and calf raises (instead of just squats). I'm currently 5 weeks post-Woodlands. Calf is slowly healing but still noticeable on runs. Today, I ran about 10 miles at \~9:00 min/mile, which felt pretty good, but a tiny bit sore.

I'm planning to run Boston Marathon in two weeks, but not race it, focusing on continued recovery."

### Training
After closely missing a PR in Berlin due to some IBS/gut issues, I won a free entry to the London Marathon via a New Balance draw. I felt it was God's Providence giving me a second shot at a PR. So I spent some time rebuilding mileage and was pretty set on going back to Daniels 2Q, which gave me my marathon debut time of 3:43:01. But then I got an email from /u/runningwritings (John Davis PhD) that was asking for people to test-drive a marathon training plan from an upcoming book he's releasing called ""Marathon Excellence for Everyone"", which incorporates what he calls 'full spectrum training' based on the teachings of coach Renato Canova.

It was a good read and I was excited to give it a shot. After running 2Q at 95km per week for two weeks, I switched over to John Davis's plan. It was an 18 week plan that spent 8 weeks doing a 'general phase' which covered a number of different paces, 5 weeks doing a 'marathon supportive phase' which started to zero-in on marathon specific work, and then a final 5 week 'marathon specific phase' which was even more focused on goal race pace work. 

Paces in the workouts are all based on percentages of paces - like 100% marathon pace, 85% 5K pace, etc... John Davis has a handy calculator to crunch it all out.

The training plan sprinkles in a lot of variety - Kenyan progression runs, fartlek work, and of course, the classic Canova sessions like alternating KM, 4x2K @ 110% MP, 3-2-2-1 km at 108-109-110-112% MP, and so on. Kept it really interesting!

The first 5 weeks went pretty strong averaging about 85-90km/week. I missed a week due to illness, but was back to it the following week. One thing I appreciated about the training plan was the way John had you pick training paces based on percentages, but factoring in some wiggle room based on how far away you were from your last best effort. This definitely helped make the workout paces more approachable and winnable, without feeling like I was getting buried by the workouts.

I ran a tune-up half which is where my last few half marathon PBs have been, but the course was changed last minute, and I think my legs were a little too beat up so I had a pretty discouraging 1:48. But I was still hoping that things would work out in the long run! I started to feel some lingering lateral right knee pain and some ankle stiffness after this race, but it seemed to recover. 

By week 10, I was really starting to feel like I was building towards a breakthrough; I was about to hit my 3rd week of 105km+ week which is the highest mileage I've ever run. Reading that sentence again, I know now why things got derailed at that point. 

After a Sunday 30km long-run that had a ton of decline and speed, my lateral right knee pain flared right back up. I tried to run through it the next day, but wound up making it worse. PT shut me down for 3 days and had me on a gradual return to run and strengthening, guided by my symptoms. It came at the worst time, and I basically missed most of the key workouts. Super bummer. But this was the first time I really listened to my physio - the goal became recovery and being race ready to run strong. I was able to get back to the training plan to some extent about two weeks before the race and ran a dress rehearsal of 26K, with 6-5-4-3km at 100% goal marathon pace (5:20/km) with 1k floats at 85% marathon pace, which I hit. But I didn't hit the weekly mileage after 10 weeks.

### Pre-race
It's my 10 year wedding anniversary and we decided to make a family trip out of it! We arrived on the Thursday and did some light sightseeing; not too much walking. Picked up the race kit and some Bandit/Tracksmith London gear (I'm such a sucker.) Had a hard time with the jet lag and carb load, but wound up getting 7 hours of sleep the night before the race. I was dreading seeing the London Marathon email warning us about the heat the next day.

### Race
I still had it in my mind to try and shoot for a PB, but I would start conservatively and see how things felt. After warming up at the start and the potty trips, I was already fully sweating and feeling the heat of the sun.

I ran pretty consistent and conservative splits for the first 10K and lapped my watch every 5K. At that point I realized it wouldn't be a PB-day with the heat and just decided that I would try and finish strong. I already hit the main goal of showing up to the race able to run. 

The stretch between 10K and 20K were the most fun - I felt like I was floating in the air and it was a blast. The crowds in London were incredible, and I was so inspired by the charity culture of the London Marathon. Seeing so many runners with their causes emblazoned on their race vests filled my heart and the crowds really turned up to support so many different charities.

22K was when nature called and I decided, well PB is out of the picture anyway so may as well not poop myself. So I stopped, re-attached my bib, had a nice little poop, and got back to it.

You can see the wheels start to fall off around 25K and it was a grind from then on. My heart rate didn't quite drop out, and so I feel like it's more of a muscular endurance issue as opposed to not having the aerobic ability. Cadence stayed pretty strong and I was proud of being able to finish on two feet without needing to walk. It was pretty harrowing to see so many runners crashed out by the side of the course, some within a few hundred meters of the finish.

I finished 4:08:05, by far my slowest marathon. I didn't run a PB, but instead I've been saying that I ran a ""PIDMB"" - 'personally I did my best'. lol. Hobby jogger wins.

### Post-race
I'm gonna enjoy this last week with the family and take a good long break from the marathon. ChatGPT analyzing my race says I'm close to a breakthrough. Maybe. I think I need some more time letting my body get used to high mileage without intensity instead of trying to do both at the same time, which is what got me in trouble. Sorry, John Davis - I really wanted to give you a good test sample of your training plan. Maybe next time! I really want to give it a good healthy go for a future race, so I'll probably buy the book when it comes out.

Also, I struggled a lot with balancing eating enough for recovery, but then also overeating and maybe gaining weight, which made my performance struggle. How does one figure this out? Thanks for reading.

### Training
I came off a disappointing Marine Corps Marathon in October.  I had gone sub-3 the prior fall, with a 2:58.  I did Pfitz 18/70 for the sub-3 but couldn’t recover enough to hit all the LT and MP workouts in the middle of the block.  I re-upped for another 18/70 for the MCM but ran 75+ mpw for 2-3 months before the block to prepare.  I had a great training block, hitting all my workouts and paces but didn’t run a smart race and miss my 2:55 goal by less than a minute.  I was relying on my pace on my garmin to hit my goal and I was at 6:35 so I thought I had enough buffer but as I hit mile 24/25 and did the math, I realized I was behind. I tried to pick it up but couldn’t make up the time, as I ended up running 26.8 by GPS.  I beat myself up for a while because I had a <2:55 in my legs but was complacent and had a bad race strategy.
I needed 6-8 weeks off from serious training after the MCM so I opted for a 12/70 instead of an 18/70.  The training block wasn’t my best.  I underestimated how much more difficult the 12 week was and winter is always more difficult because I ski with the kids which eats a day of the week and we take a week off to go to a destination mountain.  I again couldn’t hit my target paces for some of the LT and MP runs.
### Pre-race
Given the underwhelming training block, I was vacillating between sending it for the <2:55 and just running a sub 3 and enjoying the race.  A friend had a workshop in Boston the day after the marathon (great planning) so they came out to hang out with me before the race.   I bounced back and forth on what my goal should be but ultimately said that I didn’t have a great training block so I would take it easy out of the start and be happy if I came in <3:00.
The one other change I made is trying to use PacePro on my Garmin, given my trouble with pacing last time and that I anticipated a good bit of weaving.  I loaded up the marathon route and put in a target time of 2:55.  I figured I would just be watching the gap grow throughout the race but I would know where I was
### Race
There are enough Boston reviews write by more talented writers that I will not add much here.  I will just say that I started in Wave 1, Corral 7, based on my qualifying time of 2:58.
I broke the race into 4 blocks mentally:

1) Start to 13.1 - Just don’t go out too fast, don’t waste energy weaving.  Hopefully feel really good through this segment.  I ended up running this about 30s ahead of schedule.  I had some niggles that I fought all training that sapped my concepts, twinges of left ITBS and tightness in my right glute.

2) 13.1 to 15.  Stay in control and on pace

3) 15 to 21.7. Tackle the hills.  This is where I figured my I would make or break the race.  I train in Seattle, which has a fair number of hills but this was my first time on the course so I didn’t have a good idea of how tough these hills are.

4) 21.7 to Finish.  I looked at my watch as I crestead heartbreak and I was 30s behind my pace.  I felt pretty decent and put down the accelerator to see if I could make it up.  I made back ~22-23s on the downhills coming off heart break but stayed stubbonly 7-8 seconds behind the pace in miles 23 and 24.  I dug in one more time in the back half of 24 and got to 5-6 second head of target pace.  I did not enjoy seeing the underpass coming up and the mini climb.  Once I hit mile 25, I knew I had enough in my legs to keep a 6:20ish pace for the last 7ish minutes.
### Post-race
Super happy with the time after an imperfect training block.  Once the sub-2:55 seemed feasible, I focused so much on the race that I missed out on some of the experience.  I don’t remember seeing the heartbreak hill sign, Boston College kids, or Citgo sign.   The crowd support for the last 4 miles was like nothing I‘ve ever experienced and definitely helped keep the legs moving.

Edit: darn... Messed up the title.

Course: The course was beautiful and super duper flat. Start out on the outskirts of the city but quickly got into the countryside. About the first half was outside the city which was beautiful but overall pretty sunny. Mix of paved road and a little bit of narrower walking path. Just after the halfway point you make your way back into the city, then head down through a tunnel. You pop out around KM 30 or so to make your way down around the lake, across the lake, and back to the finish. There's not much 'urban' running, but the views along the lake are nice.

Support: There are a few spots where I wish there were a few more aid stations (I think first one is not until 5.5 KM, and then next one is 10.5 KM), but the ones that there were ran great - I'm definitely a middle/back of the pack runner and stations were always stocked and ready for me. They don't have gels, they give out bananas, oranges, and cookies (haven't seen that before!), had a carb/electrolyte drink at most (not all, from what I could see) stations. Crowd support was relatively good, especially in the towns/city, there were definitely some stretches out in the country without spectators. 

Expo: Relatively bare-bones, just a few little pop-up shops, but picking up the bib was super easy. The whole expo is in a big tent along the lake.

  
All in all, it had the vibe of a medium local-ish race. It didn't thin out as quickly as I'd expect, but it wasn't a problem at all. Some small annoyances (there is a relay race as well, and it seemed like some of the transfers were at narrower parts, so I got jostled pretty strongly by someone who obviously had just jumped on the course, while I was in KM 26 or something). The half marathon started 75 minutes earlier, so I don't think we ever saw those runners.

My biggest issue is that it felt pretty hot (maybe it was just me?) - it felt like so much was in the sun, and with a 9 am start you didn't really have a cool first half. I think it got up to low 70s, so I think It was more sun than temp.

Overall a fun race, pretty well-run, and I'd definitely consider running again! it's also one of the best deals out there - I think the first wave of early bird registration is about 100 USD or so."

# Background

The Northshore Half Marathon weekend had been on my club's schedule for a while.

I didn't give it much thought since I was registered for the NYC Marathon and had been going through that training for 11 weeks. If I continued training for NYC, my plan was to do the BHM 13.1 in Birmingham, Alabama, as a hard workout on October 6 since it's a challenging course with 541 feet of elevation gain and would give me a good idea of if/how I could handle that undulation ahead of NYC. Needless to say, a hard half the week before wouldn't be advantageous for a strong effort the following weekend.

Long story short, I opted out of the NYC Marathon and will instead focus on doing the Houston Marathon alongside my club in January. Making that decision opened up this past weekend and I was eager to race again since I hadn't toed a starting line since April. To my - and most of my club's surprise - both the 10 miler and half marathon were sold out earlier than expected. I debated on driving to Pensacola for a half marathon, but ultimately decided on racing the 5k in Mandeville since it still had some spots open.

I had NO idea what to expect, though, since I did 11 weeks of marathon training prior to this.

# Pre-Race

I woke up around 3:45 am in order to get all of my race day rituals out of the way before meeting a teammate to carpool to Mandeville around 4:45 am. It's only a 30-minute drive across the Causeway, but with the race being in a state park with one small two-lane road as the only way to get in and out, it has been known to bottleneck. Plus the 10 miler and half marathon were scheduled to start at 7 am, compared to the 7:30 am start for the 5k. Needless to say, we didn't want to take any chances.

Yet, somehow, all of my teammates in the 10 miler were crunched for time and in the haste of getting to the start line, my teammate grabbed my singlet out of his car. I didn't notice it until I went to get mine after finishing up my pre-race strides. Good thing his singlet wasn't too small for me, but it did have the wrong bib attached. ""Too late to do anything now,"" I thought as I took my spot at the front of the corral.

# Race

I told a teammate the night before the race that I wouldn't mind if I finished second or third, because that would mean someone equally as fast - or faster - came out and that would allow us to push each other. Well, when I got on the start line and looked around, I quickly realized it would be another solo mission.

Not having a time goal - or having specifically trained for the distance - allowed me to race freely. I figured I would go off effort alone and only check my watch if I truly felt like I needed to at the moment.

I shot off the start line and quickly settled into what I thought was a solid pace. It didn't feel too fast like 3k pace, nor did it feel too slow like 10k pace. After a few minutes, I took a quick glance at my watch and saw 5:05/mi. Before I had a chance to think one way or another about it, I crossed the 1 mile mark.

5:04.

""The second mile is the most important mile of a 5k,"" I thought. ""Keep it going.""

When I made the U-turn for the out-and-back course, I saw I had a sizable lead over second place. Even though it didn't feel that big, the results showed that I was up by 30 seconds at that point. (Spoiler alert: I ended up putting 50 more seconds between me and him the rest of the way to win by 1 minute, 20 seconds.)

I got back up to speed and the 2 mile mark came into view.

I split my watch - 5:01. Just a little more than 1 mile to go.

It was around this point where I felt totally in the zone. That's such a GREAT feeling.

I opened up my stride a bit more and heard the announcer's voice getting louder as I picked up the pace. He said something about how the leader of the 10 mile was running at record pace. I tried to let every course marshal that I passed know that I was in the 5k, not the 10 mile. I put my hand up to show five fingers, too, if that meant anything to them (I probably looked like a lunatic). Eventually word got back to the announcer as I made my way past the 3 mile mark and down the homestretch to the finish line.

I broke the tape with arms held high and forgot to stop my watch right away. I walked over to the race director and timing company to let them know what happened with our singlet mishap. Thankfully we got it all sorted out without much ado. Before I left the tent, I asked for my official time.

""15:27.97 or 15:28, if you're rounding up.""

That was a course record, a PR and my first sub-15:30 5k in a race since 2008.

# Overall Thoughts

Did I expect to PR in the 5k after 11 weeks of marathon training? Not by a long shot.

But I knew if I put in a good effort, something good could happen. That's all I wanted to do.

I need to bottle this mentality and continue to use it each race and workout going forward.

Several days after I ran the Aramco Houston Half Marathon back in January, I plugged my time into the VDOT Calculator to see my equivalent race performances. Granted, I raced that half marathon on the tail end of a severe case of RSV, but that time was the barometer for my fitness at that exact moment.

### Background 

I am a 44 year old male (152 lbs) with several years of casual running experience. In recent years, I’ve attempted to mitigate my mid-life crisis by investing a lot of time and energy in running. Have run 8 half marathons over the course of the past 20 years. On February 8, 2025, I achieved my half marathon PR of 1:30:50. (That race report is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/s/43hAAUI7gU).) 

I ran my first full marathon in NYC in November 2024 (3:26:31). I registered to run this White Mountains Marathon in May and the Berlin Marathon in September 2025. My goal—which felt extremely ambitious—was to qualify for Boston in one of those next two races (3:15:00).

### Training

I followed the Pfitz 18/55 plan for this training block. After a full week off following the NYC Marathon, I ran approximately 40 miles per week through the rest of November and December. I officially started the Pfitz plan on 12/30/2024. The Mesa Half Marathon, where I achieved my PR, marked the end of Week 6 of that 18-week marathon training plan. 

Training went well for the bulk of this block. I converted one lactate threshold workout to a general aerobic run after the half marathon but otherwise completed every workout and long run as scheduled in the plan. I trained based on a goal time of 3:10:00 to account for a Boston cutoff that I hope will be 5 minutes or less.

Here is a breakdown of the rough pacing I used as a guide during this training block based on my perceived level of fitness and goal time:

| Pacing Category | Heart Rate | Pace Range |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Marathon Pace | 82-88% Max HR | 7:15/mi |
| Lactate Threshold | 82-91%% Max HR | 8:20-9:04/mi |
| General Aerobic | 72-81% Max HR | 8:20-9:04/mi |
| Long Run | 75-84% Max HR | 7:59-8:42/mi |
| Recovery | <76% Max HR | >9:26/mi |

I did try to be aware of my heart rate but I was not a stickler about remaining in the recommended range, particularly for faster efforts and on long runs. If I’m honest, I still struggled to slow down as much as I should have for some of the lighter efforts. My general aerobic runs were probably closer to the 7:55-8:20/mile range. On recovery runs I would sometimes get a few miles above 9:00/mile but seldom did I average over 9:10/mile for any of those runs. 

The most challenging workout during this block was about five weeks out from race day: an 18 mile long run with 14 at marathon pace. I did hit the goal pace but that run took a lot out of me and left me questioning whether I could actually hold a 7:15/mile pace on race day. Aside from the Mesa Half Marathon early in the block, I did not do any tune up races during this cycle. Instead, I incorporated two 10K runs that I ran hard—short of an all-out effort but faster than lactate threshold. Those were both great for building confidence and helping me to assess where my fitness was in the lead up to the race. I ran the first of those in 41:09 and the second one at 40:35. Both of those times represented new PRs for me at that distance.

I did some hill work (uphill and downhill) throughout the course of the training block but not as much downhill as I thought I should have given the nature of this downhill course. There are a lot of rolling hills where I run so I think that even though I wasn’t doing “hill-specific” training, my legs were getting at least some of that conditioning in the course of my general training schedule.

I tapered for approximately three weeks consistent with the dictates of the Pfitz plan. I was feeling pretty achy and sluggish in that final week before the race. Was definitely in my head but tried to put trust in my knowledge that I followed every step of the plan through the entire 18 weeks.

### Training Conditions and Gear

I live in Maine. Due to cold and icy conditions, I completed about 50% of my training runs on a treadmill. As an older runner and one who is newer to more structured training, the major challenge has been to increase mileage while keeping the risk of injury as low as possible. Have had some slight but ongoing discomfort in my right hamstring and Achilles tendon but I managed to keep those discomforts from developing into anything more debilitating in this training block. I try to do basic strength training about twice a week. (After the Mesa Half Marathon, I noted that I wanted to develop that component of my training more but I have not really done this. I am hoping I can be more structured when I transition to my training for Berlin.)

I train almost exclusively in the Hoka Skyward X. I have gout and hallux rigidus (stiff big toe arthritis). The stiff plate, aggressive rocker, and cushioning have helped mitigate the symptoms of those conditions. Prior to finding this trainer, I experienced recurring and sometimes debilitating pain in each of my big toes. Because of the shoe adaptation and more careful monitoring of flareups, I made it through almost all of this training block with any significant disruptions in my training schedule due to health reasons. 

I did about a handful of my speed workouts in Hoka Cielo X1, which provides a plate to protect my toe along with responsiveness and bounce from the foam that helped generate some really snappy workout efforts during these months. 

### Pre-race

Arrived in New Hampshire on Saturday morning. Attended the race expo that afternoon. The expo was fairly standard. Not a lot of swag but good energy and efficient setup. I also picked up a pacing bracelet. I had spent a lot of time thinking about pacing and had a plan in mind. The bracelet was generally consistent with what I planned based on my pre-race research. 

We stayed at the Hilton2Suites, which was one of several hotels affiliated with the race. (It was also dog friendly.) Cost was reasonable, the accommodations were comfortable, and the location was just minutes from where I needed to catch the shuttle to the starting line on race morning.

I was fairly diligent with carb loading and hydration for the few days leading up to the race. I tend to have a sensitive stomach so I tried to keep things as simple as possible. Lots of bagels and pasta. I ate a plain pasta dinner at around 4:00 p.m. on Saturday. I was in bed by 7:30 p.m. although it took me a while to fall asleep. 

I woke up at 3:05 a.m. Had a few sips of coffee to get that essential plumbing moving. Success. Expecting a lot of rain, I applied more Body Glide than usual. Very glad I did! I caught the shuttle at around 3:40 a.m. It was about an hour ride from the shuttle pickup to the staging area at the start. I ate a bagel and finished my coffee during that ride. 

It was a very wet morning but thankfully not too cold—low 50s F. Arrived at the staging area, used the porta potty and then did my best to hunker down, thinking about my efforts to get to that moment while sipping sports drink for the next 45 minutes. 

I had a disposable poncho and layers of disposable clothing to stay warm and (mostly) dry. Was happy that I wore different shoes and socks on the shuttle. It was very nice to put on dry racing shoes (Alphafly 3) and socks to have relatively dry feet at the start of the race.

There was not a ton of space for warming up but because of the wet conditions small crowds (approximately 1200 racers), my pre-race routine was not bothered or derailed. After a short delay, the race started under steady rain at around 6:15 a.m.

### Race

Miles 1-5

The decline in these initial miles is significant (about 1400 feet). My plan was to go out at around 7:00 pace but given the substantial decline, I was flexible about going quicker based on my perceived effort. My paces were, in fact, quicker than planned but I truly felt that my effort was well within the range that I would expect for the start of a race. 

The downhill was certainly noticeable—significantly smoother (and easier) than the start of the NYC Marathon (or most of my long runs, frankly). I worked on maintaining a quick cadence with short strides to put as little pressure as possible on my quads as I navigated the downhill. That seemed to work for me. I didn’t notice any more muscular fatigue in this downhill segment (or overall on this downhill course) than I do in any other race or long run effort. 

Miles 6-10

While still feeling relatively fresh and composed, these next five miles for me were about settling in. Before the race, there was quite a bit of chatter about the uphill segment coming between miles 10-12. I was a bit in my head about that incline. 

I didn’t know if I would use the pacing bracelet but I found it very helpful during this segment and then throughout the remainder of the race. Because the pacing band is calibrated to account for elevation changes, it was a useful tool to gauge my effort in the context of where I was “supposed” to be at each mile marker in the race. With the assistance of the bracelet I approached the uphill segment knowing that I was about one minute ahead of the prescribed pace for a 3:10:00 finish. That buffer gave me peace of mind and freedom to moderate my pace as needed to minimize exertion during the climb.

Miles 10-12

The hill takes place in an up-and-back segment of an otherwise point-to-point course. It was challenging but when I got to it I felt prepared for it. Perhaps expecting something even more daunting,  I was able to lean into my experience running on rolling hills during the training cycle to navigate it fairly smoothly. It was approximately 200 feet of vertical and mostly gradual. I did allow my pace to drop significantly through this portion to prevent excessive fatigue but I did not feel at all derailed from my overall race plan and was still able to make it through this segment slightly quicker than contemplated on the pacing bracelet. 

The turnaround for the descent was very motivating. It was still too early to start feeling like I was “in the clear” but having observed several runners knocked down by the hill, I was feeling relieved and confident that I still felt strong and relaxed.

Miles 13-20

The field noticeably cleared after the half marathon marker. By the half marathon mark I was feeling mostly recovered from the uphill effort. My breathing was relaxed and I was settling back in around goal pace. 

This chunk of the race was described as “rolling hills” but it definitely felt more flat and downhill. There were a few short blips with slight climbs but, at least based on my experience, future racers should take heart that any perceived inclining segments in the latter half of the course are short lived.

I do think it is worth flagging the substantial camber in the road throughout much of the course. It wasn’t just in this segment but I think I was noticing it a bit more at this point in the race. I tried to be as strategic as possible, running at the center line of the road to minimize hip fatigue and using the camber to assist my effort to run some micro tangents and do my best to run no more than the straightest line through the course as the road weaved back and forth. 

I’ll also note here that my decision to stay toward the peak of the camber as much as possible also helped me avoid puddles and runoff that were present on a recurring basis on this very rainy morning. 

Miles 20-26.2

I felt very good when I hit mile 20. I continued to feel strong and was beginning to feel more confident that I would be able to hang on to reach my “A” goal. My stride still felt smooth and my breathing remained controlled. 

Then, almost out of nowhere, I felt the threat of stitch coming on at mile 23. I tried not to panic. I was about to have my 5th gel but decided to forego it. I opted to suck on a salt tab and got a good sip of water at the next mile marker. (I had a few salt tabs over the course of the race. I feel like they help mitigate the sweetness from the gels and also help keep my electrolytes in check.) I slowed slightly, focused on breathing, and pushed through it. 

By mile 24.5 that discomfort mostly subsided and I forged ahead to the finish, with a final 10K under 44:00. I busted through the finish line with a sense of pride, accomplishment, and euphoria that, I suppose, are what this is all about. 

Oh, and I got that BQ!

### Post-Race and Overall Impressions 

The course was spacious and comfortable throughout. The immersion in nature is fantastic but beware that there are almost no spectators in this race until mile 25+. I wondered what that would be like and whether I would want headphones to help carry me through it. I decided against headphones and I don’t regret it. 

For a Mainer who feels quite at home in the damp woods of New England, being able to hear the cascade of the river and streams throughout the course was very nourishing. I felt extremely focused and at peace throughout the entire run. I absolutely loved the crowds of the NYC Marathon but this race demonstrated that I can still conjure that race energy and adrenaline in the near silence of the White Mountains with nothing but the sounds of my breath, the cadence of my shoes hitting the pavement, and my own thoughts for 26.2 miles.

I truly didn’t know whether a BQ was in the cards for me. I am so grateful for my health, my mobility, and the support of my incredible wife, which have all made this running journey possible for me. I feel so fortunate to have had this experience. 

I know that the Revel marathons are the source of all kinds of strong feelings for some runners. I tried not to engage with too much of that because I didn’t want to absorb any negativity that could impact my goals or undermine the value I place on the work I put in to get here. Qualifying for Boston has been a driving force for me during these past 2.5 years as I have built towards this. After New York, I knew that the downhill course would increase my chances of achieving that goal. But I knew it wouldn’t be easy. And it wasn’t easy! I  worked my ass off and I got the BQ. I did that with a lot of love and support from people around me and a lot of diligent commitment to myself. I am so emotional and so excited about that. But I also learned so much during this training block and in this race—about running, about myself as a runner, and about myself as a person generally—that is worth so much more than the numbers on the clock at the end of the race. 

Whether you seek a BQ, a PR, or you just want to tackle a different type of race where you truly have the opportunity to block out the noise in your life and do something special, I wholeheartedly recommend the White Mountains Marathon. 

I am very excited to continue on this journey!

**Background**

My (33M) first marathon was Tel Aviv in 2023, where I ran 2:51. Followed that up with Valencia later that year, bringing the time down to 2:44. Funny enough, I actually started marathon training just to build strength and endurance for shorter races. But something about the training style clicked - I preferred the higher mileage and steadier pace work over the intense 200-400m intervals needed for 5-10K training. It just suited me better.

Being an Austin local worked in my favor - most of my long runs over the past 8 months covered the hilliest parts of the marathon course.

**Training**

My path to this marathon started with summer 2024 which was all about speed - chasing a sub-16 5K (got close with 16:15) with lots of track work at lower mileage (50-60mi/80-95km). But honestly, I was happier when I switched to marathon training in September.

I started with some ambitious training, hitting 70-77 miles (115-125km) per week with CIM in mind and a goal of 2:34. Then came a classic case of doing too much - in late October, I stacked a tough track session (25x400m at 5:15/mi (3:15/km) pace) with a 20-mile (32km) long run (6:24/mi, 3:59/km pace) the next day. Result? A nice gluteus tendon injury from overuse. Had to reset: took a week off, followed by three weeks of easy running at 40mi (64km) per week. Somehow thought it would be a good idea to do two of those weeks in Flagstaff at altitude - because recovery wasn't hard enough already.

Coming back from injury in early December, I signed up for the Austin Marathon (Feb 16) and Houston Half-Marathon (Jan 19), figuring the half would be a good fitness check. To build up for Houston, I aimed for 55-65mi/week (90-100km), with speed sessions on Tuesdays and Fridays and long runs on Saturdays. My first solid speed session post-injury was 25x400m repeats with 30-second recovery at 6:10/mi (3:50/km) pace. It felt surprisingly good and showed I hadn't lost everything during the downtime.

The build continued with some key workouts that shaped my fitness:  
\- 2x6km fartlek alternating 6:26/5:53 mi (4:00/3:40 km) pace  
\- 14x1km at 6:15/mi (3:55/km) with 1-min rest  
\- 12x1km at 5:47/mi (3:35/km) pace with 200m rest

Then a 16mi (25km) long run at 6:24/mi (3:59) pace really confirmed my endurance was still there - that run in early January, two weeks before the Houston Half, was a huge mental boost.

What's interesting is that I did almost no tempo runs before the Houston Half. I went in without really knowing what pace I could hold, but somehow pulled off a 1:16 (5:48/mi, 3:37/km). That gave me some confidence heading into Austin.

The three weeks between Houston and Austin were solid: 60mi, 72mi, 65mi (96km, 117km, and 106km).

Key sessions included:

* 25x400m at 5K pace
* 4km marathon pace + 3x1km at HM pace
* 5x3km with 400m rest (2 of those a little slower that marathon pace and 3 a little faster than HM pace)
* 3x2km at HM pace  + 6x500m at 5:20/mi (3:20/km) pace
* 12x1km at marathon pace with 1-min rest
* 19mi (30km) at 6:30/mi (4:03km) pace (marathon course preview) two weeks before the marathon.

**Pre-race**

Race week was pretty straightforward:  
\- Easy 5-7 mi runs at 8:00/mi (5:00/km) pace everyday except 5x1km at HM pace on Tuesday  
\- 3 days before: switched up nutrition: less sugar, red meat, and protein, more carbs (bagels, pasta, pizza, dates, rice, etc)  
\- 2.5 hours before: bowl of oats + coffee, easy 2.5mi run + 3x100m fast  
\- 2 hours before: Skratch energy bar, PB&J toast, 16oz isotonic drink  
\- 30 minutes before: Gu gel

**Race**

The plan was to take the first 5K uphill section slower and then make up time on the next 5K downhill. Started feeling pretty strong and after 10K my average pace was my goal marathon pace. But side stitch started and overall I didn't feel that great. Looking back, it probably started because of that brutal uphill in the first 5K followed by the quick descent which hit me harder than I expected.

The Enfield hills between miles 9-12 (15-20km) were no fun, but there was comfort in familiarity. After getting through them so many times in training, I just didn't see myself breaking there.

Around mile 14 (22km), I got a reality check - spotted a guy far ahead of me running in jeans. It took me until miles 17-19 (28-30km) to finally pass him. There's nothing quite like chasing someone in denim for a few miles at 6:10/mi pace (3:50/km) - really shows you that no matter how good you think you are, there's always someone out there doing something more impressive.

After mile 18, things actually started feeling better. The flats and descents let me lock into a decent 5:55-6:00/mi (3:40-3:46/km) pace, but it was getting harder to maintain. By mile 23 (37km), my legs were screaming, with each step requiring conscious effort. Knowing the notorious hill in the final mile was coming, I was trying to hold the pace for as long as possible. I passed the female leader at mile 24 (39km) and got up the hill at 7:40/mi (4:45/km) pace before giving everything I had left for the final 400m.

Nutrition during the race:  
\- Liquid Gu gel 1 minute before the start  
\- 5 Maurten gels, one for every 26-28 minutes, alternating caffeine/non-caffeine  
\- Water/isotonic drink at nearly every aid station

**Post-race**

Looking at the numbers, I think 2:36-2:37 might be possible on a flat course. The side stitch situation is still a mystery - it keeps showing up in marathons but rarely in training, so there's probably something going on with my nutrition, breathing or hills-pacing that I need to figure out.

Legs got pretty destroyed on those hills, but that's just Austin for you. For now, I'm going to spend a few weeks moving as little as possible, then start building towards Chicago. After battling Austin's hills, a flat course sounds pretty appealing right now.

### Training

My last marathon was a year ago and also at Sydney where I ran 3:03:48, you can read about it [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/running/comments/16kwy3y/race_report_sydney_marathon_racing_the_heat/). Not long after that race I came to the conclusion I had gone as far on my own as I reasonably could and it was time to get a coach. I'm sure I could have continued to bumble my way through and become a quicker runner but my rate of progress over the last year has been much faster thanks to having a more structured training plan and *intentional* workouts. The first six months from last marathon was all about building up speed, I didn't realise at the time but my coach put me through a couple of 5k training blocks and brought my pb down from a 19:01 to 17:24. I then did a half marathon training block and that took my HM from 1:26:52 to 1:19:50. During the marathon training block I also had a HM race where I was then able to take another minute off that time. 

My weekly schedule widely varies due to my work but an average training week looks something like Mon - 1hr easy, Tue - hard workout, Wed - 1hr easy, Thu - rest day, Fri - threshold, Sat - 40min easy, Sun - long run. During the marathon training block the workouts both got slower and threshold became longer, the easy days / long run also got longer and some were with efforts. My final long run before two week taper was 1hr easy into 15k@4:00, 1k easy into 5k@3:50. 

It was after this long run that everything fell apart. The following day I went gokarting with a friend, spun out and injured my side the crash. At first I thought I'd just bruised myself but after a few days it was still extremely painful to breathe, which was a concern. 

On top of this, a week earlier I'd caught a cold which I thought was mostly dealt with on that final long run, as I was able to get through the run, it was tough but I got nailed the paces. However it came back twice as hard afterwards, my very easy tuesday workout compared to previous weeks I could barely hold on to pace, constantly coughing my lungs up. Then on the friday threshold I completely blew up, I couldn't manage to run a single km at mara pace, this was a massive knock to my confidence less than two weeks out from race day. It was time to see a doctor. After an examination it was confirmed I had a chest infection, immediately I began to take the doctor prescribed antibiotics. And then the scans came back, fortunately I hadn't broken the rib but I had a fracture / internal bruising, nothing to be done but give it time to let it heal. 

Over the next week and a bit, I slowly but surely improved, the antibiotics cleared the worst of the infection and my breathing got easier each day. On race day eve I was still coughing but no where near as often and my rib only hurt when I took very deep breaths. My confidence still wasn't there but after a call from my coach, he was able to pump me up somewhat with his advice for the race and by reminding me that the work I'd done didn't disappear. 

Tl;dr - A very strong mara block build up to the worst taper imaginable. 

### Pre-race

History might not repeat but sometimes it rhymes. Last year I titled my race report racing the heat and clearly the organisers were also concerned about this as they completely removed the HM race from the event to allow the marathon to start earlier at 6am. I mostly liked the earlier start time but fortunately it wasn't needed this year as the heatwave hit two weeks earlier and by race day weather was forecast for a very comfortable high of 18ºC (64ºF). No, the weather had something else for us instead: 'damaging winds' as my weather app very politely told me, which would increase throughout the morning. Well, can't control the weather but at least they fixed the trains right? 

Well... not exactly. The organisers tried to schedule more services but there was union action meaning less trains and stopping at every station to slow things down. Not that this mattered as my line was, same as last year, cancelled for trackwork and the replacement buses weren't going to get me to the start line in time. Luckily the new metro line which had just opened provided a decent solution, I was able to drive most of the way into the city to reach Sydenham Station, and then catch the metro to the Victoria Cross station, just a few minutes from the start line, however it did mean having to wake up at 3:15am. Getting off the metro and *boy* it was cold, all that heat training I did a few weeks ago seemed quite silly and maybe even counter-productive. Luckily there wasn't any wind. Yet. 

Walking up to the starting area and ducking into some nearby secret toilets that I won't disclose to avoid the queues, I was able to spot a few friends and caught up with them. Then the announcement, the gates for group A, my group, were about to open and that we would need to be in before they closed them off behind us at ~5:30am, half an hour before gun time. I did some very quick strides and stretches and utilised the standing urinal to free myself from the nervous pee (what a godsend), then hustled for the gate. 

It opened and everyone marched forward and straight into confusion. This was the only part of the day which I felt hadn't been adequately explained. (the 72 page event guide sent out was extensive) There was another fence in front of us, blocking us from being able reach the actual road, we were all still on the grass and so everyone just bundled up like sardines, most people seemed unsure about what was going on but we all assumed that *any moment now* they'd open the gates. 

Fortunately sardines was a good way to be at this point because the wind had started up and it was already bitterly cold. Because the fence had mesh on it, you couldn't see what was going on on the other side and while the road had speakers, it seemed like they hadn't considered the waiting area so we couldn't quite hear what the announcer was saying. All I could see was the top of the pacers flags poking over, wait does that mean people were lined up with them? It took some time to realise they were just doing their warm up strides.

~**Bang**~ - 5:50am, a couple of people looked panicked and there was some murmurs but most people realised it was just the wheelchair race starting off. 

~**Bang**~ 6:00am, a lot more people looked panicked this time, ""wait, was that the starting gun?"" someone asked. These people were quelled as others confidently told them it was just the elites starting, wave A would begin at 6:05am. 

A minute later the gates were moved and a trickle of people started to move through, it was agonisingly slow. 6:03am and I finally got through and was on the road, however I had no time to appreciate the setup of the start line as I darted my way forward, searching for the 2:50 pacer that I knew I needed to find and stick with, I wasn't about to make the same mistake from last year, starting further back and spending the entire race playing catch up. Just as I reached the pacer-

~**Bang**~ 6:05am and the race was on. 

### Race

We took off down the hill, the course started not next to Luna Park this year but in North Sydney. This downhill start definitely felt much more thrilling as people battled against the instinctual urge within them to pick up the pace and hurtle down the road towards the bridge. 

The bridge. Iconic as always, unfortunately we were robbed of the picturesque postcard sunrise photos due to some clouds on the horizon but none the less stunning and with blue skies above it looked like we were in for some stellar weather. I settled in around the 2:50 pacer and a large group that was following him. Just as I started to get comfortable with my position in the pack, we ran into our first roadblocks. 

It wasn't just the elites who had started at 6:00am. I had completely forgotten that it was also the age group world championship and they had also all started on the same gun. While for their age these folk are absolutely crushing it, an 89yo running an incredible 5:30:00 marathon may as well be standing still to a pack of a hundred people running at 4:00min/k. Suddenly we were weaving all over the place, side-stepping and trying not to trip each other over as we avoided colliding into the age groupers. Someone near me said 'this is just ridiculous' and I have to agree, they should have ensured that the age groupers knew, at least for the first few km of the course to stick to one side of the road to allow safe overtaking. We continued our overtake for the rest of the race but it became mostly a non-issue after the first 10k once people had spread out and the people we were overtaking were also running a bit quicker.

After the bridge, aside from weaving through age groupers things became very peaceful. I actually enjoyed it mostly, soaking in the relative silence of early morning Sydney, only broken by the sound of shoes hitting tarmac. However it did feel like the course was lacking a bit of energy. Turns out I was right as I found out after the run that several spots where DJ/performers were supposed to be playing hadn't had their generators delivered and so had no power. Mostly a non-issue for us runners but I know it would have been a let down for those performers as well as the supporters who had gone to those sites expecting more of a party vibe. I'm sure this was a mistake the organisers will learn from. 

At this point I had settled into the pace nicely and was just comfortably following the red shirt of the pacer ahead of me. My watch was saying we were running ahead of pace but he assured me that we were right on it, given the skyscrapers around us I decided to trust him and didn't back off the pace. Risky decision perhaps given the horror stories I've heard but it paid off as he was right. The hills around the 17k mark made the pace feel a bit more difficult than I would have liked but I just stuck to the pacer like glue. 

Out past Centennial park and then turn back and a circle around it, this new version of the course felt mentally a *lot* better to me than last year. Maybe the lack of heat was playing a part but not being trapped in the park for so long made the k's go by faster. However the wind became everyone's biggest enemy. Once out of Sydney CBD, the protection of the buildings was gone and the wind picked up. Our pace group which had thinned considerably by 21km began to form lopsided V formations to try and best avoid being buffeted by winds as they changed direction, taking turns moving to the front with the pacer doing the lords work at the point. At one stage I ran out from the protection of the formation to throw out a gel wrapper in a nearby bin and very nearly got knocked over as the wind caught me. 

At 35k we turned a corner and suddenly the wind was on our backs and we had a downhill in front of us. Several people took the opportunity to open up their stride and pull ahead of the pacer. I considered doing this, I knew we were near the end. But I decided in that moment that I had everything to lose and little to gain by making a move. Sure, I could have picked up some extra seconds off my time, but I also could have been caught out in the wind alone or go too hard and blow up. I told myself that no one was really going to care if I was a 2:49 marathoner or a 2:47 marathoner, but finishing at 2:51 would be a different story. So I just stayed with the pacer, at this point there was only maybe three of us with him and he kept the energy high, hyping up the crowd as we went past. 

Around and down towards mrs macquaries chair, the crowd cheering next to the Domain was insane, I've never heard it that loud before on a race. Then we hit the small steep downhill and for the first time my legs buckled just ever so slightly, a reminder that my muscles were screaming, maxed out by the distance and any wrong step could cause them to fold, would I be okay for the final downhill to the finish line?

Around the chair and back up the hill, I slowed intentionally, ever so slightly, letting the pacer move ahead knowing that if I tried to keep the pace flat, the effort would increase on this insidious, deceiving hill. But my spirits were high, I knew I only had 2k to go now and I was feeling much stronger than I had a year ago at this point in the run. 

Back onto the flat and I picked up the pace now, catching up to the pacer one final time. Thank you David, I stuck to you like glue for 41k and now you were waving me on to greatness. ""Send it Cam!"" he yelled as I finally allowed myself let go of the discipline of my 4:00min/k pace and lean into the final downhill. Now I was flying and the final flat before the opera house finish was coming up. Eyes up this time, I didn't soak in the crowd last year but I wouldn't let that happen this year. Would I slow down once I lost the assistance of gravity? 

No, rounded the bend and saw on the finish line clock it was at 2:54:30 and counting up. Somewhere in my subconscious a voice said if we'd started 5min behind gun time I had to race that clock down to the second to finish under 2:50. 100m sprint, 2:55min/k pace after running 42km and with the roar of the crowd it felt easy. ""I did it!"" I shouted in relief as I crossed the finish line. How generic, gotta work on that one I think. 

### Post-race

I think the clock was 2:55:02 when I crossed but I stopped my watch and looked at my time and saw I was comfortably below 2:49, thank goodness! No time to stop though, we were all ushered to continue walking. Collected my medal and a bag they handed out with some food/water. The plan I'd made with my wife was to meet her at the 'reunite zone'. Something the organisers had planned where there would be flags with different letters on them and you'd be able to sit under the flag and wait for the person who was looking for you to come and find you. A great idea, only I couldn't for the life of me find this reunite zone, nor could my wife. And none of the staff seemed to know anything about it. Luckily I'd put an airtag in my zip pocket and she was able to find me that way and informed me of my time 2:48:53. No idea if we just missed the reunite zone entirely or if they somehow forgot to set it up. 

After enjoying a toilet stop, short lie down, the fun of leg cramps, another toilet stop and some water, I was up and walking. Queued briefly for the photo spot that had your finisher time but the queue was ridiculously long and not moving anywhere near fast enough so gave up on that. Changed into some comfier clothes and hit up the same italian joint as last year, even though it was barely 11am by the time we got there for lunch. 

All in all, there was really only a couple of very minor issues from what I saw this year. Otherwise the event was incredibly well organised. The volunteers were amazing and there were so many of them along the entire course, so cool! I think they could have used a bit more of a briefing so every knew what was going on but that will also come with time as all the moving parts of such a big event become more routine. In my mind there is no doubt that Sydney *will* be a major next year. And with the elites like Brimin Kipkorir Misoi breaking our all-comers Australian marathon record this year, this hard, hilly course has proved it has a hidden potential."

### Training
I (29M) ran the LA Big 5K last year (day before the marathon). At the time I weighed 250 pounds, and my 5K time was 46:31. I had done cross country in high school, and after the 5K I felt jealous of seeing people picking up their bibs for the LA Marathon. At that time I made two goals: 1) that I wanted to beat my 5K time from high school (27:44), and 2) I wanted to run a marathon. Initially I did run for the rest of that first week in March 2024, and then it basically dropped off. 

Around July, I remembered my goals and decided to join the LA Running Club (LARC). I went to one of their track nights and struggled through it. Later that week I went to one of their Saturday runs. I started out with a run-walk group where they’d run two minutes and walk one minute. I found this to be a good group for me, where it was a moderate workout, with the walks being welcome breaks. The group I was running with was great, and the people were as nice as could be. They gave me so much advice and so many pointers. Before joining I had so much apprehension about being judged for being overweight and slow, but this group of folks put that all to rest. At this point the first milestone for me came: the Santa Monica Classic 10K. I ran the race in 1:18:11 (12:59 pace, since it was actually about 6 miles only). After completing this race I finally made the plunge and registered for the LA Marathon (LAM) as well as LA Road Runners (LARR).

The training plan that LARR uses has the long runs on Saturdays and slowly works its way up from 2 miles till 20 miles, with some taper weeks thrown in about once a month. Here, I started out with the Run Walk 4/1 group, with a projected 5:30 finish time. About a month later (October 2024) during one of the taper weeks I moved up to the 5 hour groups which was an all run group. That month I also ran a half marathon: Malibu Moves. Before the half, my longest run was 7 miles, so I was worried about the half. I had made the goal of doing 2:33 or less (this was an hour less than my college time for a half). I ended up running 2:32:29, so just barely made my goal.

I kept training with LARR (albeit I did a lot of long runs on my own in November/December just because of travel/going home for the holidays). I kept up with the training schedule for the most part (except for a stray week here and there around November). I kept participating in races: 5Ks, 10Ks, trail runs, half marathons, and my weight kept going down. I was happy to see my speed progressively get faster. Around January I was hit with two roadblocks: 1) I got COVID which stopped me from training for about a week, and 2) the wildfires here in LA. I hate running on the treadmill, so I ended up taking another week or so off from running. When things finally started back up in mid-January, I struggled to run our 13 mile workout in 2:42. At this point I was feeling pretty dejected, I had been continually improving and had hoped for sub 4:30, but that was seeming to be more out of grasp.

After a few intense weeks of high mileage and getting back on track, I finally came to terms that a better goal for myself would be sub 5. I made peace with that decision, and told myself that improvements happen slowly and to be happy with all that I had already accomplished. I continued training with the 5 hour group. I did the 15 miler with them, and maybe trailed one minute behind. I did an 18 miler with them a few weeks later, and ended up trailing behind by about 10 minutes. I took a long look at the run that day to see what went wrong. The next week for the 20 miler I made a number of changes: found a different gel brand, packed salt tablets, drank more water at stations, didn’t wear a long sleeve shirt. The 20 miler went as well as I could’ve hoped, I kept up with the group the entire time, and in the final mile I sped up to the 4:50 group. 

With all of this, I decided that I’d run the marathon with the 4:50 group. Since I have a tendency to positive split/trail behind the group, this would give me some leeway to keep it under 5. Two weeks before the marathon I ran in the Screenland 5K and got a time of 25:47, this was one goal I was able to scratch off from my two goals.


### Pre-race
The night before the race I went to bed at 6:30 pm and planned to wake up around 2:30 am. In reality I only ended sleeping from 8:15 pm till 11:15 pm. Pre-race jitters and excitement got the best of me. I spent the early morning hours thinking about my previous running journey. Finally around 3:15 am I headed over to the finish line, parked the car and took the shuttle at 3:50 to Dodgers Stadium. We got to Dodgers around 4:20, and I went inside the stadium where the rest of the LARR folk hang out. The first hour or so was pretty mellow, just waiting around. At around 5 a lot of my friends started to show up and I started to get a lot more energy/excitement in me for the race. At 5:50 I forced myself to go the bathroom just so I wouldn’t have to during the race. I drank two Electrolit bottles and ate one banana. I didn’t bring anything to gear check/didn’t have a phone so I had nothing to fuss with. The next five hours were just going to be me and my senses. Getting into the corral was a nightmare, our pace group went to get in around 6:20 (with corrals supposedly closing at 6:30). It was as if we were getting onto a lifeboat off the Titanic, there was so much pushing and shoving. Even as the corral security was saying that they’d let people in till 6:50 and there was no need to hurry, people were still pushing a ton. Once I got in the corral everything was pretty peaceful, and I took off my pre-race clothes that I was going to donate.

### Race
The start of the race was much more crowded than I expected. Our group (4:50) started in Corral E, which is the last of the seeded corrals. Right at the start we have a slight uphill, and I could see the pace leader start to drift off. I found myself doing a good chunk of weaving just to keep up, and I looked at my watch and noticed the pace was 12:30, which was a far cry from the 11:04 we were supposed to be doing. I told myself I needed to stop weaving and not be worried about the time, we had 26 miles to make up any lost time and I needed to conserve my energy. Once we got out of Dodgers stadium and down the hill it started to thin out a bit. The first 4 miles I was keeping up with the group but my heart rate (HR) was higher than I wanted in the 160s. At the mile 2 mark they have the first water station, and that was my first taste of really struggling with the traffic of so many people trying to get water and stopping. I took one cup, and half went on my shirt, a quarter on my face, and the other quarter cup actually made it in my mouth. We reached the first big uphill at about mile 4.5. There are drum players who are playing up that hill, and it was something I was looking forward to. Unfortunately, we were also greeted with the people yelling at us to convert to Christianity and telling us that all runners go to hell if they do not accept Jesus and repent our sins. Aside from that, going up the hill I began to trail from the group, but I usually like taking hills slower and I told myself I’d catch up with the group on the flats/downhills. After the first 6 miles, I did finally get into a groove with the more flat stretch. My heart came down to the 150-155 range, and I was doing generally well. I had gotten a hang of going to the water station and grabbing two cups. I had also come to a natural ebb and flow with the group, where I wouldn’t always be strictly with the group, but I would catch up to them every couple of miles or so.

The group was running in the 10’s to 11’s for the first 16 miles or so (our half marathon time was 2:22), and at this point I was thinking maybe I should try to push for sub 4:40. Around mile 17 I noticed the pace leader slowed down to about 13-14 minute pace, and initially I slowed down with her. I did the math in my head, and calculated that I’d need to do roughly 12/mile to get to sub 5. I decided to speed up ahead of the group to 11:30 or so pace. My thinking was maybe the pace leader is doing an easy mile, but if I slow down, I’ll just stay slow for the rest, so it’s best for me to keep chugging along. About ten minutes later, I turned around to see where the group was, but they were out of sight. At this point I realized that I had to set the timing myself. 

At the mile 18 mark, true hell began. At this point I was beginning to feel exhausted. I knew that this commenced a 4 mile out and back, and I was just wishing it was just 4 and done. I saw my parents around mile 19 and this gave me a well needed boost. Once mile 20 arrived I was feeling okay too, but once we made the right turn off Santa Monica Blvd onto Sepulveda (maybe mile 20.5) I began to really hate it. Maybe it’s the fact that that street was pretty desolate or that the sun was beaming down. I could feel so much sweat on my face. I was drinking water and electrolytes (I got lucky someone handed me a bottle of Electrolit, thank you kind stranger). For a short moment I began to feel dizzy. I wanted to walk so badly, and I asked myself if this was what it meant to hit the wall. I saw a bunch of people around me stop running and start walking. I told myself, to just keep running no matter how slow. I was worried if I started walking, I would never start running again.  Finally at mile 21 I just told myself, I need to put up with one more hour of hell and I can walk away with no regrets and feel accomplished.

At mile 22 I saw the LARC tent and they gave me some ice (which helped cool me down), and it was a humongous boost to see some familiar faces, and one of my running friends ran with me for a few minutes. Once I hit the turn around at mile 23, I did the math that I needed to punch in roughly 12:30 splits to get to my goal. I was feeling confident at this point and I knew that I just needed to continue. At around 24.5 or so we turn back onto Santa Monica Blvd. I passed the 25 mile mark, and I saw that my time was 4:42 or so. I had 18 minutes to complete 1.2 miles, I knew that barring something going wrong I would do it. That last mile went so slowly, I literally just counted the minutes. The crowd was really closed in on the streets, there was only space for people to run 2-3 wide. Though it was annoying to weave through runners at this point, I did appreciate having the crowd and the energy (as opposed to the empty previous stretched). Once I hit mile 26 I saw that I would make my goal, even if I walked the rest. I decided I would sprint the last 0.2 miles, and focused on crossing the finish line with a smile (and not touching the stop button on my watch in the finishing pics). In that final stretch my family was there cheering me on, something I barely noticed since I had basically tuned everything out. I turned around and waved at them, and kept charging on.


### Post-race
Once I crossed the finish line, all I wanted to do was sit. I expected that I’d have a bigger feeling of accomplishment, this was a goal I had for a year now, and something I had worked so hard for. But when the moment came, I was just like “okay it’s done.” I went to the medical tent real quick to grab a bandaid (as my nipple began to bleeding around mile 13). I basically limped around the entire secure zone (which was easily a half a mile long). I finally met up with my family and friends in the mall, took photos with them, and subsequently got lunch with them.  I am happy to say I achieved both of my goals, and lost 80 pounds in the process. 

As I reflected on the marathon, a few things I thought of:
- I am struck by the compassion of others. I have never been to an LA Marathon as a spectator, despite living here for three years. Seeing all the spectators with signs, and the spectators handing out fruits, water, sodas — I am truly amazed. Even if I never run a marathon again, I will go every year to help support others. I could not have done this without the help from the people who came out. The random person who gave me a water bottle at mile 18 and an Electrolit at mile 20 truly saved me.

- LA Marathon really needs to change the out and back stretch, it is by far the worst part. It’s as if they did not think of runners at all when making this change. I am not saying it needs to end in Santa Monica — they could elongate the course at some other point to make up those miles without having us go out and back in what is easily the most boring part of the course.

- Finally, I achieved my goals and now I am not sure what to do. I know that next year I want to run a sub 4, but it is weird that the marathon is over. It is something that has been on my mind for months and occupied so much of my brain space. For me this was such a milestone accomplishment and it is bittersweet that it is over. I am happy that I accomplished what I set out to, but I am sad that the experience has come to an end. Though sub 4 would be an accomplishment of its own, I don’t think it will be the same milestone as this first marathon was for me.

Thank you to all the folks who read the post, my apologies it was so long.

TLDR: I ran a marathon, met my goal, lost 80 pounds along the way, made friends, and was amazed by the compassion of others.

A Goal: 3:30 marathon – NO

B Goal: PR marathon (sub 3:45) – NO

C Goal: Don’t walk – NO

D Goal: Finish the challenge – YES!

 

Training:

I followed the Pfitz 18/70 plan for this training cycle, since I wanted something that was higher mileage and would allow me to really try to build some fitness ahead of the 4-race challenge.  I followed the plan nearly exactly, with a few caveats.  I did miss one short recovery run and replaced another 6-mile easy run with a 9-mile hike (I was on vacation).  I also converted some of the Vo2 max runs toward the end of the plan to threshold runs, as I was struggling with energy levels (possibly due to my overall eating plan).  The biggest change that I made, though, was to rearrange the runs in most weeks pretty thoroughly to fit my schedule.  I always did the runs for a given week during that week, but the ordering was very…diverse.  I’m not sure how much this might have affected my progress.

 My overall progress, though, was great!  I avoided any injuries, completed all of the runs, and was able to really push my target times throughout the cycle.  There were 5 20-mile runs in the plan, including a 22-miler at around the midpoint (which I pushed to 23 because I was feeling great that morning), and several more runs of 18+.  I did a 10k and a half marathon as training runs during the cycle, and PRd each by nearly a full minute/mile off my previous record pace.  The taper was fairly short, which I liked, and still included a fair amount of running, which I also liked.  The week before the races was 46 miles including a 13-mile long run, and I came into race week feeling fresh and rested but without any of the taper tantrums I’ve had with more aggressive tapers in previous cycles.  Coming into the race weekend, I had settled on a target time of 3:30 and felt solid about my ability to achieve that.

 I rotated Novablast 3 and Novablast 4 shoes for the majority of the training cycle, and purchased a pair of Alphafly 3s (my first super shoe!) for the marathon.  I ran a half in those shoes about a month out to check fit and feel, and had a wonderful experience – set an 11-minute PR and felt great throughout.  All in all, I felt extremely confident going into the challenge.

 

Fueling:

I had worked out a fueling strategy that worked during my previous marathon, and stuck to it for this training cycle and the races.  I didn’t fuel at all during the 5k and 10k – just a breakfast of fruit and some chocolate before the race, along with a fairly carb-heavy diet overall during race week.  For the half and full, I ate the same breakfast but also used Welch’s fruit snacks during the race, one pack every three miles.  This level of fueling worked very well for me during my previous marathon and during my long runs, and eating the fruit snacks gives me something to think about for a good half mile every three miles. 

 Unless it’s very hot and/or humid, I generally don’t hydrate during a run – I struggle to get it down without choking and prefer to hydrate well before and after.  Since the weather for these races was pretty cold (high 30s/low 40s for everything but the half, which was high 50s), I didn’t take any hydration during the races.  While I know that this is not an orthodox strategy, I’m accustomed to it, and I don’t feel that it negatively impacts my performance. 

 

5k:

The challenge started off on Thursday morning with the 5k, which is a circuit around Epcot.  It was very cold and windy at the start, and I was not looking forward to standing around the corrals before the race.  I waited in my car as long as I thought I could, and then headed up to the starting area.  I wore several layers, including an outer jacket that I intended to be disposable if I felt that I needed to.  We got started without a hitch, and the race honestly went by in a blur—after all my training runs, 3 miles felt super short.  I kept my jacket the whole time, and honestly never really felt warmed up.  I felt some tightness in my legs throughout, but nothing problematic and seemed to be just due to the cold.  Overall, pretty straightforward.  This race was untimed and I apparently didn’t start my Strava correctly, but I estimated my time at about 23 minutes – a little faster than planned, but I honestly just wanted to get off the course and into the warm!

 

10k:

The 10k on Friday morning was more of the same, although it was a tad warmer (maybe 42 as opposed to 37 the day before).  I again wore several layers with the outer jacket, and this time I decided to ditch it about 3 miles in when things started to warm up.  I enjoyed this race, and was able to get some good pictures as I was smiling at the cameras throughout.  I also stopped (actually backtracked) for one character picture – with Goofy, since the Goofy challenge is a part of doing Dopey.  Finished a little under 50 minutes, which was fine with me since I was trying to take it easy and conserve energy for the marathon.  I also left the course feeling great, which was a nice contrast to the previous day.

 

Half:

The morning of the half was drizzly and gusty, but with a much better temperature than the previous two days (high 50s).  The rain cleared up right before the start, and conditions were fairly perfect throughout except for a little more rain around mile 9.  This was one of the most fun races I’ve ever done.  I didn’t care about my time and in fact was deliberately trying to run slowly to save energy for the full.  As a result, I was taking a pace that just felt awesome, making faces at the cameras, trying to get them to catch me in a heel click (which none of them did!), and taking character photos.  Even with all of that, I finished under 1:50 and felt like I was in amazing shape for the marathon the next day.  I was pretty euphoric the rest of the day on Saturday – I spent some time at Disney Springs and relaxed at the hotel, looking forward to the big one!

 

Full:

The morning of the marathon was forecast to be nearly perfect conditions – mid 40s and dry.  I again wore several layers, with a disposable jacket just to help keep me warm in the starting corral, since I wanted to be there early to get a good starting position.  I also wore my Alphaflys for this race after using my Novablast 4s for the previous three.  I felt a little overly cold during the wait, but I figured I’d warm up once I got out on the course.  I actually discarded my jacket after about a mile in anticipation of warming up more over the next few miles…in hindsight, I kind of wish I hadn’t done that.  It was around 43 at the start and actually got colder throughout the first 2/3 of the race.  I never felt warmed up at any point during this race, and was always on the edge of feeling chilled throughout.  I think this was a major factor in how things went overall, which I’ll talk more about later.

 The first 8 or so miles of the race felt good.  I went out a little too fast, but I have a tendency to do that and knew I could pull it back a little after a few miles.  I enjoyed the first part of the run through Epcot and Hollywood Studios, the characters on the course, and the overall vibe.  It’s also always a great time running through the Magic Kingdom, and this was no exception—plus I got some absolutely fantastic castle pictures.  Early in the MK portion of the race, though, I started to feel some instability in my left knee, which I hadn’t really experienced at all before.  I tried to focus on form and settle things down, but it continued to slowly intensify, and by mile 10 I knew I was in trouble.  I stayed focused and kept pushing through to Mile 19, but every mile got harder as my knee got more painful and I started developing other hot spots as I compensated.  I tried to slow my pace but it didn’t make any difference, and finally at mile marker 19 I decided to stop and walk to see if that would calm things down.  It seemed to be helping, and at mile 20 I felt ready to pick back up and run again.  That lasted about a quarter mile before my knee wouldn’t stand it any more, and I knew it was going to be a long day.

 I walked the rest of the race, with things gradually getting more painful even walking.  In another situation I might have DNF’d, but I definitely didn’t want to give up on my challenge medal and feel like the other races were partially a waste.  Plus, these races are expensive and I wanted the bling!  Once I started walking, though, I got progressively colder and my whole body began to tighten up and get more painful.  I tried twice more to run a little, once when the 3:30 pacer passed me and once when the 4:00 pacer passed me, but both times lasted less than 100 yards.  I finally crossed the finish line a little over 4 hours, almost 40 minutes slower than my goal time.  I was very disappointed in my time, but proud of myself for finishing the challenge.

 

Discussion:

I’ve thought a lot about what happened, and I think I’ve identified the combination of events that led to my breakdown.  It should be noted that while I’ve had some minor IT pain on and off before, I’ve never experienced anything like this either in training or in my previous races.  Based on my recovery and everything I can remember about my experience during the race, I think there were three factors that came together to create a perfect storm: 1) An unstable course, with lots of camber on the highway portions and very uneven footing in the parks; 2) Poor lacing on my shoes, which caused additional instability; and 3) the cold, which caused extra tension and exacerbated the IT band irritation from the instability.  I could feel my feet slipping slightly in the shoes through the first part of the race, but didn’t think it was severe enough to worry about—in hindsight, I should have stopped to relace them at that point.  I especially noticed this movement going downhill, and when my knee blew up it was the downhill slopes that were most problematic (I almost fell down a VERY slight slope in the last two miles because I had so much trouble navigating it).  I didn’t experience the same lack of stability in the half I ran in the Alphaflys previously, but in that race I had been extremely diligent about lacing my shoes tightly (I prefer my shoes very tightly laced in general). 

 Another part of why I think this combination was the problem is how much heat has helped with my recovery.  Coming back to the hotel after the race, I really thought that I might need to get medical attention—I was in fairly severe pain and the knee felt very unsteady.  Once I got in a hot shower, though, the pain disappeared almost entirely.  It was actually kind of unsettling how quickly it went away!  This pattern has repeated several times over the past day or so; my leg will stiffen up, but once I put some heat on it it’s like a magic eraser for the pain.  Putting that together with what I know about my shoes and the course, I think that the cold and the instability really built off one another until it became impossible to recover the spiral.

 All in all, I’m proud to have finished this challenge and happy with myself for pushing through a tough situation in the marathon while making what felt like the best possible decisions in the moment.  I’m still very disappointed at not being able to reach my goal, and I feel a little let down by not proving my fitness at the marathon distance again (I know I can WALK that far, but I wanted to run it and feel that satisfaction at my fitness level).  That said, I think I learned a lot about what can go wrong, and if I was going to blow up in a race this was probably the one to do it in.  I still had 3 great experiences, I completed 48.6 miles, and I got to meet some fun Disney characters (DARKWING DUCK!!).  I’m going to try to take away the lessons from this one and come back stronger in a redemption marathon later this spring…and maybe another Dopey next year."

### Training
Based on my training block, I anticipated great things in a spring marathon. I originally signed up for the Jim Thorpe Marathon last weekend, but fires broke out in the hills around the town the weekend before. I had to make a decision the Monday before to avoid being charged for my room, so I rolled the dice, cancelled the room, and signed up for the Long Island Marathon the following weekend.

The training has gone well this spring. I did all my workouts, felt good on the long runs, and had a couple of good in-block races. I made other lifestyle changes as well: less alcohol, overall a better diet, and a carefully-measured 3-day carbo load before the race.

My sister is fundraising to run Boston in 2026 (her last Abbott major) and I want to run the race with her. I qualified for Boston in my 40s, so I know it can be done. At my current age (62), my qualifying time is 3:50 minus the buffer, so probably 3:44-ish. Now the question is whether I can find another 12 minutes by early September. Suggestions are welcome.

### Pre-race
One advantage in running this race is that I could reach it from my apartment in Brooklyn, albeit with an early start. I got up at 4:30, got dressed, grabbed my go-bag, and headed for the car. The early start was necessary to avoid road closures in Eisenhower Park in East Meadow (the main spot for the marathon).

The drive was easy at that time of the morning and I got to the park at about 5:45am for a 7:30 start. I sat in the car, drank some water with hydrating salts, ate some overnight oats, and did some reading (I'm currently reading ""Sunrise on the Reaping,"" by Suzanne Collins -- the 2d of her ""Hunger Games"" prequels. It's quite good.)

Around 7, I ate a packet of maple syrup and walked to the nearby portapotties. The race directors did a great job laying out the start area; there were loos everywhere, and nobody had to wait more than a few minutes for one.

After that, I did my standard 1-mile warmup and then walked to the starting line. All the marathoners were in Corral A, with the larger group of half-marathoners in Corrals B, C, and D behind us.

### Race
As promised, there were pacers, but there was a weird gap: one at 3:35 (a little fast for my plan) and one at 3:50, which I mistakenly thought was a little slow. Oops. Given the weather conditions (temp at 60F, going up to 65F, and high humidity -- 88% to 92% throughout the race), I should have tucked behind the 3:50 pacer. Instead, I ran the first 2-3 miles about 20 yards behind the 3:35 guy and paid the price. When the humidity is high, my legs get sore and tired much more quickly, which is what happened today. 

The biggest challenge was the course itself. I traded a point-to-point, downhill course through the woods for two loops (hate loop courses) of a twisty, turny, mostly uphill course on a mixture of wide-open concrete roads, some asphalt, a track, and five miles of sidewalk around and through a golf course. To be fair, the organization and support were excellent, but I should have listened to my gut and chosen a different race.

All that being said, I can take away some positives here. In my second phase of marathon running (I did 20 in my 40s, so far 5 in my 60s), I posted my best time and broke 4 hours. Despite going out too fast, I held on reasonably well and accelerated over the last two miles to the finish. My takeaway there is that my carbo-loading was on point. With another training cycle, more start discipline, and slightly better weather, I think I can close the Boston gap.

### Post-race
More props to the race organizers regarding the post-race amenities. Finishers were handed their medals, a blanket, and an ice-cold bottle of water. Further along, volunteers handed out nice thermal tumblers and a hat. There was a good mixture of food: various fruits, a good selection of bagels with jars of peanut butter, nutella, jam, etc. Each runner had a coupon on their bib for a cup of Corona, and there were a bunch of food trucks and live music. All in all, a very nice set-up for a weekend running festival.

One final amusing note: both the bib and the finisher's medal exhibit clear signs of ""swag creep."" Both are the largest I've gotten to date. C'mon folks, let's dial it back a bit.

My interest in marathon running began when I volunteered at the 2018 NYC Marathon. With zero direction and a quick Google search for an ""easy marathon training schedule,"" I ran a couple of miles every other day in preparation for the 2019 NYC Marathon. I finished with a time of 04:16:34, but I got ahead of myself and hit the wall at mile 18, making it an absolute nightmare of a race.

After the 2019 NYC Marathon, I was determined to prepare better for the 2020 Marathon to avoid the same outcome. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, the 2020 Marathon was canceled, dampening my motivation to run. I was able to defer my race to 2021, where I was motivated to run again with an ambitious time goal of 3:45! I trained by following a Google image running schedule with rest days between every run. During the race, I paced poorly and hit the wall at mile 20 but managed to finish with a time of 3:50:59.

Not hitting my mark encouraged me to try again in the 2022 NYC Marathon. (I know… I know… there are other marathons that I could sign up for, but I was determined to have my revenge at NYC at the time). This time, I picked up Hanson’s Marathon Method and followed every single workout in the advanced running plan. That year, I had the goal of running a 3:20, but I ended up running 3:33 because of poor pacing and a fueling mishap.
After the 2022 marathon, something clicked for me, and I actually started to enjoy the training process. In 2023, I followed the same plan and ran a time of 3:19:50 in Toronto and the NYC marathon in 3:13:33, but during both races, I still struggled with cramping.

For 2024, I really wanted to try to run a sub 3-hour marathon, so I signed up for the Jersey City Marathon and Corning Wineglass Marathon. I decided to scrap my prior training and fueling methods completely and start fresh. I followed Pfitz 18/85 and managed to run all of the prescribed workouts except for one week when I was on a family ski trip. I also spoke to a sports nutritionist about a new fueling strategy.

### Pre-race
On the day prior to the race, I kept my food intake really simple and controlled. I had a piece of bread in the morning, a salmon bento box for lunch, some plain pasta with pesto for an early dinner (4:45pm), and for “dessert,” I had a Never Second C90 drink mix in 16oz of water, and a Skratch High Sodium Drink Mix in 16oz of water. I prepared everything for the race before going to bed; I filled 3 16oz Hydra Pak soft flasks with 2 scoops of Tailwind Naked flavored and 4 Never Second C30 gels. I was pretty nervous at night and had trouble sleeping; I managed to sleep at midnight.
On race day, I woke up at 4 AM and ate one piece of white bread and drank a 16oz water bottle of Never Second C90 drink mix + 1 serving of LMNT unflavored. I got everything ready and drove to the race starting area parking lot by 5 AM. I managed to nap for another hour in my car at the parking lot and woke up to my 6 AM alarm. I got my throwaway clothes on and jogged to the corrals to use the porta-potty and found my place in the corral in between the 2:50 and 3:00 pacers.

### Race
**Miles 1-23:**
This part of the race felt absolutely amazing. The weather was great, the course wasn’t jam-packed with people like the bigger races, it was easy to find my rhythm. I was a few seconds running slower in the early miles and transitioned to running even splits for most of the miles leading up to 23. I planned on sipping on my 2 scoops of Tailwind in 16oz of water concoction and taking one gel every hour. I planned to meet my family at mile 9 and 18 to exchange my empty soft flask with a new one. I was able to successfully see them at the planned spots, and it was amazing to see them cheer for me with such enthusiasm. There were a couple of hills in the course, but overall it was mostly flat as advertised.

**Miles 23-26.2:**
At mile 23, the day got hotter, and the fatigue started to build. I looked at my watch and realized I had banked enough time that even if I jogged going forward, I would be able to run a sub 3:00. I decided to keep it conservative because I didn’t want to crash and burn, so I ended up running a 6:50-7:00 pace for the last 5k. The last 1.2 miles were pretty emotional for me. I saw a running buddy cheering and running alongside me on the sidelines at mile 25. It gave me flashbacks to when I first met him at the final 800 meters of the 2022 NYC marathon when we were both cheering each other on while hanging on to make it to the finish line in the blistering heat together. I was also caught by surprise to see my family split up and cheer for me in different sections of the last 1200 meters. I crossed the finish line with a time of 2:57:22, and I don’t know what got into me, but I started to ugly cry uncontrollably.

### Final thoughts 
I was in total disbelief that I finished in under 3 hours! When I started running, the idea of running a sub 7-minute pace for a full marathon was crazy to me. I’m so happy that I kept trying even after failing to hit my goal so many times. I wish you all the best of luck in your running goals and aspirations! You got this! Thank you for reading!

# Training

I started running consistently almost exactly 1 year ago. Not sure why I decided to start now in my 30's but so far it has been rewarding. After my first half Marathon in Berkeley in November 2023 I immediately signed up for the full Marathon in San Francisco. That gave me several months to slowly work up to 50 mpw before starting my official training. For my actual training I did a slightly modified and unofficial Pfitz 18/63 plan, running 6 days a week and peaking at 67 mpw ([see full detailed worksheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cLDqqKtmijRWMV7koRupiJQUvk4aNV_C/view?usp=sharing)). Including the marathon race itself I ran 997 total miles over 18 weeks. I did 3 separate 20 mile long runs with 2 on the San Francisco course to get to know it better.

# Pre-race

Woke up at 3:00am, ate, got dressed and got to the bus at around 4:00am. Arrived at the starting corrals at around 4:30am. Used the bathrooms twice and did some basic stretching. Lucked out with the weather as it was absolutely perfect.

# Race

**First Half**

I started off decently enough and tried to keep calm at the beginning. I didn't see any 3:15 pacers so I just did my best to stay slightly ahead of the 3:20 group. I'm a type 1 diabetic and my blood sugar started higher than I would typically like for a long run but over the course of the race it evened out. I also happened to see another diabetic, a young women in bright yellow, and made sure to point to my glucose sensor and wish her luck. She cruised past me later in the race so I am sure she had an awesome day. I ate a GU gel every 4 miles and made sure to get fluids at every aid station. My biggest weakness by far were the hills and despite running on the same hills in training I absolutely underestimated them. I was so slow on the bigger inclines near the bridge and even though my heart rate was fine my calfs were struggling.

**Second Half**

No surprise that the second half was much harder than the first. Every hill that came along was so much harder than the first half despite being smaller. The down hills did not feel good either as they put a lot of strain on my legs. The last 10k was brutal because it was no man's land. I barely got redirected to the alternate path multiple times which meant there was no one in front of me to catch up to, just an empty street. I pushed through but it was a struggle and my pace dropped a little. In the last couple of miles I realized 3:15 was out of reach but I tried to finish strong including a sprint at the end.

# Post-race

My leg are absolutely trashed. I have never been this sore before. haha. Immediately after the race I was walking like a zombie. I have a massage booked for tomorrow which is either a great idea or terrible one. I will find out soon.  Overall feeling good about the race. I already signed up for CIM in December and I am hoping to reach my 3:15 goal then or surpass it if I'm lucky.

### Training
My training for the past several months has been following a modified version of the Norwegian system, adapted for non-pros. For those unfamiliar, the Norwegian system was originally created by Marius Bakken and then implemented by the Ingebrigtsen family, and recently also Narve Nordas. It's been wildly successful and a very hot topic in training recently. The aspect most people are familiar with is the emphasis on threshold interval workouts at certain lactate concentration levels, typically done twice a day on workout days for ~5 workouts a week. My adaptations are based on a few letsrun threads and reading Bakken's papers, and are designed to put the principles in practice for someone who isn't running the mileage that the pros are and isn't close to the level they're at. The main differences are (besides pace obviously) that I did slightly larger single workouts rather than doubles, and ran based on pace + HR + effort rather than a lactate meter.

Edit: the letsrun thread is here: https://www.letsrun.com/forum/flat_read.php?thread=12130781

My weekly structure typically consisted of 6 days of running: 3 easy runs and 3 workouts, for a total of 60-70 miles (70 most recently). These workouts would usually be picking one of these 4:

25x400 at ~8k pace (83s), 30s rest

12x1000 at HM pace (3:36/5:47), 60s rest

8xMile at slightly faster than Marathon pace (6:04), 60s rest

6x2000 at slightly slower than Marathon pace (6:10), 60s rest

(Rest for each is standing or slow walking, reps under 1 mile usually on the track, at or over a mile on a road loop)

I also did 4-8x barefoot strides in the grass after many of the workouts

Easy runs were kept very easy for me, usually around 8mi at 8:00, but that can fluctuate +/- 30s depending on how I feel and conditions.

I've been doing almost exclusively these workouts 2-3 times a week since late June (""almost"" because life gets in the way, and sometimes I'd hop in someone else's workout for fun). The paces I kinda just settled into over time as ones that are attainable that I can hit for all the reps and still have a few in the tank, ie not gassed at the end. I haven't done many traditional long runs, though each of these workouts usually hits 10-12 miles with wu/cd and sometimes I'd extend those to hit 15ish.

So how does it work? There's some specific physiology stuff that I'll probably mis-explain, but the way I like to describe it is that improvement over time is a balance of short term and long term stimulus, and recovery. Maximizing your long term stimulus while having adequate recovery will produce gains. If you absolutely hammer a single workout, that's a lot of short term stimulus, but it's unlikely you're gonna be able to maintain doing that several times a week for months at a time. With this method, you get a LOT of volume at fast paces with fairly minimal recovery needs - I'm getting 20+ miles of work between 8k and M pace a week. That's a lot of long term stimulus without having extreme recovery needs.

What are my results? Note I live in Colorado so most of these are altitude times. I'm also 27M. In the 5k, I cut 25 seconds off in a few months down to 16:49, finally breaking my HS PR. In the 10k, I cut 40 seconds over a few months, in an un-tapered C race. For the half marathon, I dropped from 1:18:1x to 1:15:3x, about a 2:40 drop. I'm currently training for my first marathon in December, and the goal is sub 2:40. Planning to keep my training the same, but add in some long runs to make sure I'm prepared for that part.

Edit to add: a big other change I've had is that this is the first time I've been able to consistently run over 60mpw without getting injured. My prehab routine is better than it used to be but I think a lot is also attributable to changing up my training plan.

### Race
Figured I might as well give a brief race report while I'm here! It was a really nice flat race at sea level, which was a pleasant change from my usual runs. I had done some research on Strava of last year's race, and it looked like most people had it clocked at 13.25 so I knew my watch ""avg pace"" would probably be ~3s off, so I targeted a faster watch pace of 5:44 rather than the 5:47 I'd need for sub-1:16. I hadn't done that much specific work drilling that pace into my head so it wasn't too big a deal to adjust slightly.

I went out a little hot, hitting 17:41 through 5k, versus a planned 18:00. Luckily that didn't seem to hurt me too bad, and I kept up the goal pace pretty well the whole race. I latched onto another guy around my pace for 4ish miles until he picked it up a bit, but that helped a lot. The race was a little weird in that the elites started 3 minutes earlier, so I was catching some elite women in the last few miles (cutoff for them was 1:25), which was much better than being deep in no man's land. I felt great through 10mi and started picking it up a bit. I finished like a freight train over the last ~150m, so I think I probably had significantly more left in the tank and could maybe have handled more aggressive pacing. But this was my first HM where I didn't have some significant issue pop up so I'll take it!

Fuelling/drinking wise, I had one Gu right before the race, and no other food during. I think I got a sip from 3 water stations. I don't train with water much so that part wasn't too hard for me.

### Post-race
I felt surprisingly good right after the race! There was a beer tent and a bit of a party, but unfortunately I had an early checkout at my Airbnb so had to jog back there to get showered and stuff. Luckily I got to have a pre-cooldown beer first.

I'd be happy to answer any questions you all have about the training stuff! I'm avoiding too many details on the race itself because I do use this account for a lot of stuff and don't wanna doxx myself.

\### Training: I began on Pfitz 12/55 but with work, kids and the grueling heat and humidity I only made it through week six before I began to feel so fatigued that I was afraid that I was putting finishing in danger. Instead I adjusted using a McMillan plan through Strava which got me to the finish line. 

I began running 20+ years ago. I average about 1200 miles a year give or take with some years under 1000 miles and a high of 1700 miles in 2020.

Prior to beginning training for this race in August I had ran about 1000 miles. I began doing Caroline Girvan workouts from Youtube in January after neglecting any strength work for the past 3-4 years and feel that that helped me tremendously both during and after this race.



\### Pre- Race: The weather was perfect. I live in the SE and I now know why there are no fall marathons here. It was roughly 48 degrees with a slight breeze. I wore an adidas singlet I purchased at the Peachtree this year and my Osprey LT Vest. For fuel I had 6 packs of Motts fruit snacks after reading from someone here that they used this instead of gels which worked perfect for me in training. I have used gels before but have never liked the taste or consistency.

Placeholder text!



\### Race: I had a lot of nerves. This was my 3rd marathon but first since 2015. I felt ok, but due to curtailing the Pftitz plan and receiving the estimates from my Garmin and Runalyze knew that I was going to have only an outside shot at breaking 4 hours. My previous best was a 4:19 in 2015, but I was on pace for a 3:40 before dying at the 20 mile mark. With that in mind I just focused on running a mile pace that was not too laborious and settled in in the 8:45-9:30ish range for the first half. This allowed me to avoid any crash late in the race and while I am kicking myself now for not going more all out,. This course was hilly. My Garmin shows 1500 feet of elevation but none of the hilly parts were as severe as what I run in here at home.  I am glad to have finished and am planning to run a local marathon this January and believe I will be able to get in under 4 hours.

Placeholder text!



\### Post-race: I called my friend to come and pick me up at the art museum and watched college football until midnight before getting up at 0330 so that we could both make our flights back home. I feel like this was a well organized race and an excellent one for people who are at or around the same experience level as me.

Context: I’m M40, have been running on and off since 2013, done a few halfs but only plucked up the courage to do a marathon at the start of the year (after a decent year of consistent mileage). I did a 12 week plan starting in Jan and hit 80km in my peak week, before getting sidelined for a couple of weeks with flu and then having some ‘taper tantrums’ (yep, these are real) with my knee in the final week of training. Suffice to say I did not go into the race with much confidence. 

I won’t go into a full race report but I lined up hoping for a 3:15 and ended up doing it in 2:57:56, ahead of my wildest dreams of a sub 3. Even more mind blowing is that I felt stronger at the end than at the start - doing a negative split and speeding up every 5k until the finish. 

Anyway, I suppose the point of this post isn’t to gloat (well, it is the internet so maybe there’s a little of that), it’s actually to say that I got so caught up in reading advice on Reddit/watching marathon tips videos on YouTube that I convinced myself that achieving something like this wasn’t going to be possible for a first timer. There is so much to think / worry about in the lead up to your first marathon but my advice would be to keep the faith, trust in your training and if you’re aiming for a specific time that you feel might just be out of reach - go for it. You never know what might happen."

I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/s/QGc3yukkxe) a few days ago about how stressed I was about my upcoming first (official) marathon asking for advice. 

Hearing others’ similar experiences was honestly so validating, definitely helped calm the nerves. The not as nice comments were also great fuel for the race ;D 


Overall I am so fucking happy with the results. I legit cried like the last 2 km (mostly because I was SO thirsty and cold but also because it felt so emotional).

1-10km: went by so fast! I was trying to hold back and not go out too fast but it was off to a good start. I waited until the 9km aid station to get water. 

10-20km: i dry ate an electrolyte tab thingy 😭 don’t know if it was even necessary but I didn’t wanna risk it, it was so chalky and salty and foamed in my mouth, luckily I timed it right before another aid station and grabbed more water right after that. Was still feeling good!

20-30km: felt so motivated at the turn around point it was emotional. I sped up and peaked at around km 27 and did my fastest split at 4:36! Had water at every aid station during this, they were half filling the tiny little cups 😭 I was so thirsty. 

30-40km: was still feeling really good for the first half of this split managing to keep a consistent pace. Then at 35 a huge freaking cold ass rainy head-wind started. It was also a bit of a more uphill section. Was not happy haha. Was just counting down until the next aid station for water. Last aid station at 39, I stopped for the first time and chugged 4 cups of water. 

40-42km: these were horrible haha. BIG wind and rain. I am very lucky I honked at the very end though! I slowed to like a 5:10 pace for the last two kilometre and I felt like dying lol. The only thing that kept me going was thinking that the faster I run the sooner it’s over. 


Then I ate 3 avocados right after and I swear they were the most goddamn delicious things I ever ate. No salt or anything, I was mfing hungry. But I don’t regret anything and although there were many learning moments, I am beyond happy with this result!! — BOSTON QUALIFYING TIME 2025!! Can’t wait for the next one. 

I am so grateful for the running community, literally saved my life. Also very grateful that I was neither constipated nor “leaky” for this run. It was fun."

**Training**

* Huge disclaimer: I’m not great at training! Combination of not having the patience/discipline to run more than 3+ times a week and finding it hard to carve the time out
* I was averaging <30 mile weeks, typically across 3 runs: speed work on a Tuesday night with a local running club, long slow run on the weekend and a third short (\~5mile) slow run toward the end of the work week
* I trained for a solid \~14 weeks, with decent consistency. Did the occasional yoga class, but not much else other than running. 
* Didn’t follow an official training program, but my fiance drew up a decent plan that incorporates some of the basics: 80% easy runs / 20% speed, peak long run of 20miles three weeks before the race etc. 
* This is my second marathon (first was CIM in 2021, where I took basically the same approach in training for a 4:11min finish!)

**Pre-Race / Race**

* Weather forecast suggested it was going to be super cold to start, but it ended up being near perfect conditions! Slight drizzle at some points, but otherwise ideal in 40's, mostly cloudy with pockets of sunshine. 
* It’s a small, but well run race. I stayed in a motel close to the start line, so it was a logistically stress free morning of walking to the start line and being on my way in <15mins. 
* Breakfast was a bagel with almond butter, and a few bites of a banana
* I know ‘*my pace*’ really well, as I basically only have one pace regardless of distance, so I didn’t go out too fast and found my groove quickly and held onto it. If anything, I got a little faster toward the end!
* Not going out too fast is truly the best advice I have for any one starting a marathon! You need to save some of your tank for the brutal 18-26 miles at the end… take it very easy to start! 
* I really enjoyed the wine country scenery and the net downhill course. So peaceful and calming to run. Crowds were small and sweet and nice little highlights across the course. 
* I had a right glute/hip niggle around halfway that I stopped twice for between miles 12 and 20 to stretch out (which helped so much!) but I kept the stops swift and was on my way again; no walking other than briefly at water stops
* I took a pee break at \~6miles
* I carried all my own gels (GU) in a Salomon running belt, and had one just before the race, after the first 5miles and then every \~3miles (which was about every 30mins for my pacing). 
* Had a Nuun Caffeine tablet pre-race and then a single caffeine gel at mile 18, other than that just normal GUs.
* I drank electrolytes / water at every aid station. 
* Nutrition/hydration was on point for me! No issues at all. But I'd practiced this on my long runs. Stomach handled it all well. 
* In general, I have a very high heart rate when I run but can sustain really long runs with it in the 170s, so I was working hard at times but felt within my usual work zones - this is definitely not the case for most others! 
* The final 3miles were the toughest for me!! I didn’t hit a wall at the 18mile mark (so grateful) but was digging deep to hold onto my pacing and finish strong - glad it worked out but it wasn’t easy. 
* Finished with a 'sprint' and a big smile on my face!

**Post Race**

* Feeling so stoked with my efforts. Was almost a perfect day. 
* I was \~1min slower than my first marathon, but basically the same split consistency throughout. 
* I recognize (and am grateful for) my results significantly outperforming my training inputs!
* Body is holding up well - will see how the hip feels this week, but otherwise I’d say I’m injury free
* I’ll probably take another break from marathons for a bit, but really did have a lot of fun today! 

Thanks for reading. And congrats to those who ran this race today!"

# Training Background and Marathon Journey:

I'm 33 years old and didn't have much experience with endurance sports until the pandemic. I started cycling in 2020 and followed structured training between 2021 and 2023. During that time, I also participated in a few duathlons, with my longest run being around 7 km.

In 2024, due to work, I relocated to a different country and couldn't bring my bike. To stay active, I began doing long runs every weekend, which I really enjoyed. As a result, I developed a weekly running routine, progressing from 5 km and 8 km to runs of 10-12 km between January and March. By April, I increased my long run to 15 km, gradually doing 2-3 runs per week with a focus on the long run.

On July 21, 2024, I completed my first half marathon (HM) without specific training, finishing in 1:59:34. Afterward, I decided to aim for my first marathon on December 1, 2024, and started structured training in September.

# Training Plan Overview:

I initially followed Hal Higdon's Intermediate plan but switched to Hansons after two weeks. My approach was to structure my training around the VDOT system, using it to determine my pace zones (zone 2 and threshold). Given my cycling background, I'm familiar with Rate of Perceived Effort (RPE), so I used a combination of three key parameters in my training: heart rate (HR) zones, VDOT pacing, and RPE. I focused on zone 2 and tempo days, adjusting some of the long runs to extend beyond the prescribed distances.

# VDOT Pacing:

* **Easy Pace:** 6:45-7:24/km
* **Threshold Pace:** 5:46/km
* **Interval Pace:** 5:12/km
* **Marathon Pace:** 6:14/km

# Training Breakdown:

**September (1st Month of Structured Training):**

* Week 1: 66 km
* Week 2: 67 km
* Week 3: 88 km
* Week 4: 65 km **Total: 286 km**

I followed the Hansons plan, which incorporates two intervals per week: one speed workout and one tempo workout.

**October:** I registered for a half marathon on October 6 to test my fitness and set a new baseline. I achieved a 4-minute PR with a time of 1:52:09, averaging 5:20/km. After that race, I used VDOT and HR thresholds to adjust my training pace.

I also did my longest run of the month: a 30 km run in 3:11, averaging 6:22/km.

**October Pacing:**

* **Easy Pace:** 6:10-6:47/km
* **Threshold Pace:** 5:09/km
* **Interval Pace:** 4:45/km
* **Marathon Pace:** 5:30/km

**November:** In late October, I took 5 days off due to work but got back into my training in the first week of November. I managed to log 66 km and 81 km before beginning my two-week taper. One of my key workouts during the taper was an 18 km tempo run at 5:20/km, which left me feeling confident about the marathon.

**November Pacing:**

* **Easy Pace:** 6:30-7:00/km
* **Threshold Pace:** 5:15/km
* **Interval Pace:** 4:50/km
* **Marathon Pace:** 5:40/km

I reduced my gym sessions to 3-5 times per week during the taper period.

# Nutrition Strategy:

During training, I mainly used sugar water for hydration, consuming 50-80g of carbs per hour. For my final tempo run, I tested the gels I planned to use on race day (Koda gels) and had no issues. On race day, I intended to consume one gel after 10 km (or 1 hour) and then one gel every 4-5 km thereafter.

My weight was around 70-72 kg during training, but during taper and race week, it increased to 73 kg, likely due to reduced mileage and consistent eating habits.

# Race Day:

I arrived in Singapore a day before the race, settled into my hotel, and picked up my bib in the afternoon. After a light dinner with my partner, I went to bed around 10 pm and woke up at 3 am for the 4:30 am start. The race was 3 km from the hotel, so I jogged there to warm up. I chose the SB2 shoes for the marathon.

**Race Plan:** My target pace was 5:40/km for most of the race, with the idea of pushing harder in the final kilometers if possible.

1-5 km: I hit my target pace and felt good, though there was some congestion at the start with the HM participants.  
6-10 km: Everything was going smoothly. I took my first gel at 10 km, and my HR and RPE were both within the target zones.  
11-15 km: My pace slowed slightly but I thought I was still warming up.  
16-20 km: I started to feel more fatigued. My pace slowed to above 6:00/km, and my HR increased, which was unusual. I felt that i cannot push the pace above 6:00/km which is very unusual. Even during the training and my HM this distance should still be comfortable.  
21-25 km: At this point I thought sub 4:30 is possible so i tried to run at 6:30/km which is around my zone 2. But Even at a 6:30/km pace, I found it difficult to sustain. I started to walk periodically to recover. Towards 25km I now believe that I don't have the legs for today.  
25-30 km: My legs were fatigued, and my pace decreased to above 7:00/km. I was now alternating between running and walking, I am now focused on just finishing the race. No time goal. Just to finish.  
30-42 km: This was mainly a walk to finish. I could only run short intervals (200-300 meters at a time) and walked most of the way. My calves were tight, and I was struggling to keep running. I managed to jog the final stretch and crossed the finish line with a bit of a sprint but stopping short 1 foot of the line because of cramping from my left calf.

# Post-Race Reflection:

While I didn’t hit my target time (sub-4 hours), I’m incredibly proud of completing my first marathon. The training process was enjoyable, and I made noticeable progress over the three months. However, there were a few things I could have done differently to improve my performance.

**Possible Areas for Improvement:**

* **Pacing:** I likely started too fast and didn’t account for the traffic congestion at the beginning.
* **Tapering:** I may have reduced my mileage too quickly during the taper period.
* **Nutrition:** I think I'm on point with nutrition but still maybe some room for improvement.
* **Training:** Maybe more milage, also the maybe I did something wrong during the 2 weeks taper specially using the treadmill for the last week of taper.

**Questions for the Community:**

I’m looking for insights on the following:

* How did you adjust your training and tapering approach to ensure peak performance on race day?
* Have you faced similar challenges during your first marathon, and what did you do to overcome them?

I appreciate any advice or suggestions that can help me improve for future races

### Background
I’m a 29M who started doing road races after college.  I quickly fell in love with the sport, and also found I was pretty good at it. I started taking things more seriously in 2019, and eventually qualified for Boston on my third marathon in 2021.  My PRs are a 2:45:40 Marathon at Boston in 2023, and 1:18:20 at the NYC Half this year.

### Training
Going into this training cycle, I was coming off of a PR attempt and fail in Boston. I was in the best shape of my life, but the heat on race day got the best of me.  I did the Pfitz 18/85 plan during the Boston build with only one small injury, but it had sucked the life out of me.  Despite starting the year intending to do the same plan for Chicago, the race day disappointment and general exhaustion from the high mileage convinced me to chill out for this race. 

On July 31st, I started Week 1 of Pfitz 12/55.  Fewer miles and more rest days had me enjoying my runs instead of dreading them.  It felt like less of a chore.  Plus, the shorter plan meant the end was already in sight from the beginning!

I was never as fast as I had been in the winter, but I didn’t worry about it too much.  With all the heat and humidity, I focused on hitting the appropriate HR for quality sessions and didn’t overthink the pace.  I had a few Marathon Pace Long Runs that seemed to indicate I could do ~6:30’s, so 5-6 weeks out I set a vague goal of beating my Boston 2024 time (2:51:46).

The last couple weeks, I started to think even more might be possible.  My “fitness” score was about where it was when I ran Boston in 2023.  My threshold and VO2 Max sessions were also going really well. If I could do a 2:45:40 on a tough course, maybe the right day in Chicago would have something special in store. 2:45 had been on my mind as the “Fast Runner Qualifying Time” for Berlin, and I knew if I was in the ballpark on race day I’d be giving it a shot. 

My fiance and I left for Chicago Friday morning totally unsure of what to expect. I was feeling loose and confident but trying not to get my hopes up.  When friends asked for a prediction, I gave a 10 minute range.  It felt like anything could happen.

### Pre-Race
As part of my more chill approach to this race, I was paying less attention to pre race prep.  In other words, I was eating everything and walking everywhere.  We started with a Chicago hot dog, then walked along the water to the race expo.  We enjoyed a glass of red wine at happy hour, and had deep dish pizza for dinner.

Saturday I did a 4M jaunt by the start line to the waterfront and ended at the Bean.  The race expo, start, and finish all being close to one another made for electric pre race vibes.  It felt like everyone I saw was visiting the city to run or watch someone run, or they lived there and they were also on a run.  Honestly, it made me feel pretty emotional.  Before Boston I had been weighed down with expectations but here I felt loose, free, and full of gratitude for this sport.   

We did an architecture river cruise Saturday afternoon, which I highly recommend to future runners as a time off feet way of exploring the city.  We then got Italian Beef sandwiches for lunch, before I finally reeled things in for dinner with my traditional pre race meal of shrimp scampi.

At 9:30PM, I set my alarm for 4:30AM, popped two melatonin, and settled into bed.  Just like previous marathons, I did not sleep a lick.  Turns out no matter how loose expectations are, I still cannot shake those pre race jitters.

### Race Morning
I woke up and got dressed.  Went to put my Maurtens in my pocket, only to find that I’d put my tights on inside out.  Good start.  I quietly left the hotel room so as not to wake up my fiance, then realized I’d left my gear bag and had to be let back in.  Things were going great.  

Getting to the start was smooth and I was there early enough to use the bathrooms before the lines got long.  I tried to relax, meditated, napped, and watched the sunset for the next hour before making my way to the corral.  They did a touching tribute for Kelvin Kiptum and played the Chicago Bulls theme song which gave me goosebumps.  In downtown Chicago, surrounded by a huge crowd, about to take on a daunting athletic feat, I thought to myself “this is the closest you will ever feel to Michael Jordan.”


### Race
The race started with the usual awkward shuffle jog to the start line.  From there, things spread out.  It was crowded, but the 4 lane highway made it much easier to navigate than Boston’s start. 

The plan had been to go out at about 170 bpm, hopefully around 6:15 miles, and see what happened. At 2.5 miles, I saw my friends for the first time, the earliest I had ever seen them in a race.  After that, we ran north of the city and the crowd thinned a lot.  I was feeling good and confident ticking off a string of 6:12-6:15 miles.  Things were going exactly as I hoped, almost too good, and I even wondered if the wind was at my back for the first 7 miles and I didn’t realize it.

Those fears were put to rest when we made the turn back to the city at 8 miles.  This was probably my favorite section of the course.  A little quieter but some beautiful townhouses and a great view of the Sears tower as the North star.  Things were still on track, 6:15’s like clockwork.  I was keeping an eye on the HR and it was right around what I knew was sustainable, 172ish.

We whipped through downtown again at the half mark and the crowds filled up.  This was the point I started to think that 2:45 could be within reach and not just a pipe dream.  I tried to give off some good vibes to the group around me “halfway baby, easy money let’s do that again.”

Miles 13-18 were a bit of a blur.  Things were definitely not as comfortable as they had been in the first half, but no major problems. I noticed a pattern with my gels, which I took every 4 miles.  Mile 1, take gel, a nice distraction, went by fast.  Mile 2, wow I feel great.  Mile 3, hmm this feels a bit difficult.  Mile 4, this sucks but I just need to survive until the next gel, and repeat.

I saw my friends for the last time at Mile 18, and things took a psychological shift.  Without them to look forward to, the only thing to focus on was finishing the race.

I kept the splits tight through 20, but could feel things getting harder. The Mile 20 gel, instead of being a nice distraction, felt like the only thing keeping my body going.  At this point I noticed my HR sneaking up into the low 180s.  It was going to be a grind to the finish.  I started doing mental math as a distraction. I had 10K left and 40 minutes to do it.  How fast is that? Shit still 6:25 miles. 

Miles 20-22 were brutal.  I kept expecting to look down and see a 6:45 mile or that I’d fallen way off pace, but they only creeped up a little, 6:17-6:18.  Each mile that ticked off I recalculated how slow I could run the remaining miles and still break 2:45.  Anything to not think about running.  

At Mile 23, I decided to take my last gel early, but only got 3/4s of it down.  My stomach finally took issue with the fact that I’d been pumping it with Gatorade, oatmeal, and gel all morning.  That was fine.  I waited for the relief that previously came after each gel and it did not come.  Goddamn. Well, here goes nothing.

Miles 23-25 were the hardest of any race I’ve ever done.  At no point did I feel confident that I was going to be able to finish, let alone hit my goal. I was constantly on the red line of having to slow down or even yuke on the side of the road.  “Did I fill out my emergency contact when I signed up for this?” I wondered at one point.  I knew my heartrate had creeped up into the mid 180s, so I stopped looking at it.  I tried to zone out and embrace the pain for a bit, thinking “You are not a human being.  You don’t feel pain.  You are a running machine built to run 6:15 miles.”  It worked for about 45 seconds.

The prevailing thought that got me through this section was how much it would suck to get so close to 2:45, not do it, and have to go through it all again.  I didn’t care about a PR or even finishing with a good time if I couldn’t break 2:45.

Finally I hit the last mile, and the signs started popping up.  “1200 left”. I can do 1200 repeats much faster than this.  “800 left” a half mile? That’s cake.  I turned right on Roosevelt Hill and almost laughed.  I do most of my training in the Central Park hills, this bump was nothing.

I turned the corner, gave the last 200 what little juice I had for good measure, and crossed the finish line in 2:44:33.  

### Post-race
There's nothing quite like the post race euphoria. I laughed, I cried, I screamed.  It’s such a satisfying feeling knowing you’ve given everything you had.  The post race beer hit different, I got a kick out of how early they were handing those out.  I hadn’t even made it to the afterparty!

I hobbled over to a bench and basked in the after glow. While changing, I discovered a precariously placed rip in my tights.  Thank god it didn’t get any bigger or the crowd’s cheers of elation would have shifted to screams of horror. 

Next up for me is a spring half marathon that I’m still deciding on.  I will probably do 18/70 again but want to focus more on the workouts and speed.  After that, Berlin, here I come.

**Training**


I’m a 35M who was previously fairly sedentary and had become “skinny fat” due to long work hours and having kids. I started spin class in 2022 as a way to lose weight, which helped me shed some pounds. For reference, I started at 5’6” ~144lbs and by the time I was routinely running peak mileage I had dropped down to ~115lbs.

I don’t know why, but I decided I was going to start running in May 2023 having essentially not run since I was a kid, and never competitively except for 2 ill-fated months as a freshman on JV cross country in which I skipped a bunch of practices. In June, I bought a running watch. I got really excited to play with the watch and accidentally went out and did what in retrospect I can only call an unsupported half marathon time trial (with no fuel or fluids) in 1:55.37. It took my body a week to fully recover from this misadventure. In the meantime, I decided to get serious and read about how to train. This forum was very helpful, and I got the Pfitz advanced marathoning book from the library. From then on, I gradually increased mileage, with most weeks resembling Pfitz-style marathon training.

I fully acknowledge that my ability to ramp up mileage as I did without getting hurt isn’t something that everybody can accomplish. At 18 weeks from the marathon I started the Pftiz 18/55 plan, but my body felt like it could run more, so I soon jumped up to the 18/70 plan. After a while I found myself adding mileage to that plan. I ended up averaging about 75mpw for the last 2 months before tapering. I didn’t push higher mileage because that was already taking me about 9-10 hours per week.

Mileage progression:

May: 12 miles

June: 55 miles

July: 143 miles

August: 180 miles

September: 208 miles

October: 235 miles

November: 265 miles

December: 329 miles

January: 315 miles

February (through 2.5 weeks): 114 miles

I live in Austin, so I chose our marathon. I had the benefit of being able to train for the notorious hills. It isn’t an easy course with a total of 790ft of elevation gain. Many of my long runs I did on the first half of the course where most of the hills are located. Key workouts included 18 total with 14@6:44 5 weeks out. I did the 3M half marathon in town 4 weeks out in 1:22:xx in the midst of a 75 mile week. I didn’t taper for that race, and I left some in the tank not wanting to throw off the next week of training. I didn’t trust this time to be truly representative of what I could do on marathon race day, since it is a way easier net downhill course, and the Austin marathon is a different, substantially harder course. 


**Pre-Race**


I did a steeper taper than anticipated. I got covid 3 weeks out, and then I strained my hamstring two weeks out from race day. I ended up dialing back volume a ton, and, thankfully, by race day, my hamstring felt good, not perfect, but good enough to line up at the start line. This did not help boost my confidence of a good performance. I ate a bunch of cards leading up to the race, nothing special to report there.


**Race**


The weather was ideal. Starting temperature was just above freezing then slowly rose during the race. There was only a slight wind. Going into the race, I wasn’t sure what pace to target, so I opted to stick with the 3-hour pace group then re-assess in the latter stages of the race if I had anything in the tank to break away.

The Austin marathon course is not easy. The first few miles are all uphill, and then you are rewarded with recouping all that elevation gain on a nice downhill. From miles 7-12, besides a few flat stretches, there are a series of rolling hills with another few hundred feet of elevation gain. One of the toughest hills is at mile 12, but I had done that hill in many training runs, so I knew how it felt.

Through the first half I felt pretty good. I was surprised when we hit the halfway mark that we had banked about 20 seconds, since the first half is the much more challenging part of the course. Through this part, I was taking a Maurten 160 every 25 minutes. I hadn’t any GI issues during training runs, but I could feel my stomach starting to get a bit uneasy. I continued to try to get sips of water at the stations, but it was hard to get much from the cups and we were in a large enough pack that it just didn’t feel worth it most of the time. In fact, one of the two pacers for our group got tripped and went down hard around mile 16 or so. Looks like he actually finished the race, just not with our group.

By mile 16, my stomach was feeling queasy, and I began to worry it would revolt. At this point, it was tough to force myself to take sips of water/electrolytes. I nursed a Maurten gel for about 20 minutes, then ultimately discarded most of it after I realized I wasn't getting anything down. In hindsight, although I had tolerated that many carbs in my training loads, that wasn’t at such effort, and I think I would need to revise this strategy in the future. I didn’t have any gels for the last 10 miles. Thankfully, I didn’t hit the wall or lose the contents of my stomach.

The last 6 or so miles is the easiest of the course. It is mostly downhill or flat. This is where it started to get hard and my dreams of breaking away from the pace group disappeared, and my new goal was to not get dropped. There was a good 15-25 of us in a pack for much of the race, but our numbers began to dwindle significantly. I could hear people laboring around me, and while some surged ahead, many faded away.

With about 25 minutes to go, my perceived effort started to rise significantly. I glanced a few times at my heart rate, which had been under control and ignored much of the race, and was now red-lining. I could feel I was on borrowed time, but I knew we were close enough that, barring catastrophe, I would finish and that my goal was in sight.

My hamstrings started to cramp up around mile 24. There were a few instances when I was worried one (or both) were going to seize up. I changed my stride a bit, and a brief uphill at mile 25 helped the situation. It was actually a nice reprieve from the miles of flat road we had just run. I really started to eye my watch and calculate what I needed to finish sub-3.

For anybody who has run the Austin marathon, you know that at mile 26 is the worst, most cruel hill you could imagine of the entire course. I had intentionally run this before on training runs, but even that couldn't prepare me for the pain. I turned onto the hill and gave it my all knowing that it was impossible to maintain my goal pace for that section. My legs had nothing left in them, but I still passed a few people who were deeper in pain. When I finally crested it for the last two hundred meters, I gave it all I could, which wasn’t much, just as it should be.

I ended up finishing 2:59 mid. 


**Post-race**


This was tough. I’m very grateful for the pacers. Without them, there is no way I would have made my goal time. I’m excited to keep running, but looking forward to not being so regimented about the way I divide my week. I don’t really have much of a desire to chase the marathon majors. I’m going to do a local 10k in April. I’m sure I will do another marathon in the future, mainly to run it on a flat course and really see what I can do. Honestly, as much fun as it is to hit sub-3 for my ego, I enjoyed the training much more. I'm relieved for the marathon to be over to just get back to running.

### Training
Male, 35-39 age group. Used the Hanson beginner half marathon plan. Jumped in at week 9/10 after building a solid base for previous 5 month. Missed a few workouts and paces due to fatigue and sickness throughout the block which made question if I'd picked too fast a goal. Peaked at 49 MPW and ran 6 days per week consistently for the last 7 months. Garmin predictor was 1:35:55 after using for 7 months with heart rate monitor for all runs. 

### Pre-race
Trained at 5300ft elevation ran around 500ft. Used carbon Hokas for the first time (ran one training run in them). Slept great the night before and came into the race in ""prime"" condition on Garmin. Weather was great with overcast clouds and mid 40s temps.

### Race
Felt great from start to finish and felt stronger as I went. I thought my watch might have been deceiving me based on the paces it was showing. Broke race into 5 miles, 5 miles, and 5K, checking in to see if I could turn it up and each phase. Set a PR in every distance from 1 mile, 5K, 10K, and half marathon. 

### Post-race
Shocked I was able to crush my goal so hard and how fine I felt during and after. It was certainly hard but all manageable. I have a goal of BQ within the next 1-2 years and that was a great boost of confidence for that journey. Now planning what to do next, was thinking of going 10K, 5K, 10K, half marathon, marathon over next 1.5 years. For now a little rest.

I wanted to run a 3.45:00 but had to temper my expetations due to a cold so i said to me self to be happy with a sub 4.

The weather was reasonable, a litle high humidity and few degrees to warm to be ideal.

The start was good, litte bit too fast as i wanted to run a warm up around 6.30 min/km for the first 2 km and after that slowly build up to a pace of 5.25. I guess i was a bit too fast.

First 10k felt good , i noticed my pace was too fast so i decided to slow a little back to my target pace.

At 17km i noticed it got a bit difficult and a bad feeling about it.
At 24/25km i was done for, there was little left in my legs and knew i was in for a chalange.
After that it went bad fast and decided to take it slow and hoped i could take it to the end.

At 30 km there was nothing left, my legs where done. Only thing i could do was to take it slow, keep running at a low pace and hope for the best.
I was realy counting down every km.

I was not out of breath or realy tired, it was just my legs who were shutting down, there was no energy left.

I kept managed to keep running step after step and even had a revival at 40 km and went for it, sadly it didnt last long and was back to to survival mode.

Man i was glad to see the finnish line, most of all mentaly broken down and i felt my legs thanking me for stopping to run.

I feel good now, all and all it was quite an experince and i am glad to havr done it. Oragnisation was very good in my opinion and they have managed to make it i nice event.

Thanks for reading and if anyone has any sugestions to make an next experince better i am gald to hear it😊

# Training

A little hodge-podge here. I wanted a new approach. I have had several races gone wrong with obscure training philosophies. So it was a lot of reading and learning to tailor my body to my goals and learn what works for me instead of following a paid plan. Don't get me wrong, I still purchased a plan and followed a couple as sheer guidelines and learned what made my body feel good. I had one thing in mind while training: the race is the celebration, the training is reason we celebrate. 

Overall, I adopted the Hansons Methodology as this is where my body, mind, and soul kept drifting back to. I felt great whenever I followed their process. Tired as all hell, but this adventure has brought me to the most fun I have had while training. Cannot thank them enough for their ideology and explanations of how and why to train. 

The taper was weird, as with most new training plans. But for the first time, I was able to trust the process and succeed. 

Final thought while training: I did a year and a half of IM's prior to 2025 and I was sooooo fed up with the endless subscriptions and paying for this and paying for that. I really wanted to pay to learn vs paying a service to get me across the finish line. I really buy into the idea to train to adapt vs train to survive. Thats why we do these crazy things!

# Pre-race

Week before my 4yo gave me a nasty full cough that thankfully with A LOT of Zicam and rest I was able to dry up and finally get some good rest the night before. Not ideal, and I was ready to accept the consequences of my race. I still woke up with a great nights rest (finally) and continued with my pre-race setup. Macros the week leading up were upped to about 60:25:15 (C:P:F). Morning of I did my usual peanut butter and banana sandwich while sipping on my LMNT Chocolate and Coffee. Drank about 10oz of water and 6oz of Gatorade up until race start. 15mins prior I ate my final snack: 1/2 portion of Starburst for something chewy before sucking on gels and water for 3+hrs.

# Race

Setup my Garmin PacePro plan against elevation as a new tactic. Not exactly negative split, but overall a good strategy to conquer some hills. 

Miles 1-10 were a breeze. I banked arguably a little too much time against my Garmin. But I knew in the later part of the race I was going to have 5+ miles with a north wind and an extended elevation gain. 

Miles 11-20 was time to settle in. Enjoy the time and knew that the race really started at mile 20. I was sucking on gels about every 4miles and realized through here that I need to up that to every 3miles or every 5k in the future. Energy was dropping at the end of every 4miles. 

THE FINAL 10K I was dropping in energy big time. Switched to taking my final 2 gels at 19 and 22 with a Maurten 100 plus caffeine for the final push. LIVE. SAVER. Also, thank you to the 3:15 pacer who finally caught up with me and gave me some final words of encouragement to maintain where I was at. 

This was essentially my first race where I was going for a rough and fast PR and only had been taking the race as it was in the past. My PR before this was 3:44:xx and this was a HUGE stepping stone.

# Post-race

I thanked that 3:15 pacer again. Cannot say that enough. I rang that PR bell with gusto and proceeded to enjoy the post-race festivities sporting my shiny new medal and a beer in hand. 

My goals going forward are to recover for 4wks. Get back into another fabulous and devoted Hansons plan. I have another 26.2 in September where I would love to push sub 3:10 or 3:05. Still unsure whether I will go after that or take it as a half in stride with going after a BQ in January at Disney 2026. 

Thank you all for reading!

### Training
I went with Pfitz 18/55 for my training, I'd used the HM plan with great success last year to PB in dreadful weather so I had faith in myself that I could get a good time if I stuck to the plan. I chose the 55 mile one as my work doesn't really allow for doubles and I spent the winter getting back into strength training/cycling so I wanted to keep up some commitment while building on the running.


The first negative about an 18 week training plan and this marathon was that week 1 started on 23rd December, so the first week was a struggle with all the family commitments but we made it work.


I would say I stuck to the plan mostly but had to move sessions around since I take part in a series of trail races over the winter months so on the week's where I had one I would move the LT runs to the Saturday and see how I felt on the Sunday. And with the tune up races later on, I just used my local parkrun as I was either busy working on that day or there were no races of that distance nearby for me to compete in apart from the final tune up race which was a 10k. Although I didn't get any PBs on the tune up races I was only 4 seconds off my 5k PB and 6 seconds off my 10k PB during these tune ups.


I missed 2 runs of the plan due to illness but otherwise I got all the runs done. I know some people dislike the medium long mid week runs and while they are time consuming I think hitting 11/12/14 miles mid week definitely helped with my endurance in this marathon. With the vO²max stuff later on in the plan and the strides I think definitely helped with my last 600m kick in the race. 


If anyone was thinking about doing a Pfitz plan I would definitely recommend it although I think your base mileage going into it should definitely be a bit higher than he recommends as it does ramp up quickly 


### Pre-race
I live in Belfast, so I took from the Thursday before the race off work so I could fly out earlier and get settled. Luckily I have family that live in the Greater Manchester area so we could stay with them instead of getting a hotel. On the Friday morning we went out for the day so on the Saturday we could spend the day relaxing. On the Saturday morning we went to Worsley Woods parkrun which was lovely and scenic and did a gentle shakeout (Pfitz says 4 miles but I wasn't that bothered at this point) and then we spent the rest of the day spending time with family then for the dinner I made what I've had for the last 18 weeks, Pasta, sauce, and chicken.


The morning of the race, I got up nice and early and had my 2 bagels with jam and a banana and then we started to make our way to the start area. I was with 2 other people running but I was in the Blue wave so I was the first starter. We got the tram to the start area and it was quite well organised with the bag drop to one side, which I didn't do because I'd of had to have been there even earlier, and then the start area which quite a few portaloos and a urinal area so the men don't clog up the portaloos.


We got ushered into our special start access bit at about 8:30 which we then had to walk 5 minutes towards our holding pen. The negative about this is after the 5 minute was to the holding pen was there were no toilets after this point and we didn't start until 9.20 so we had 50 mins of no toilet so a lot of people started to go into the bushes.


### Race
My plan for the race was to stay with the 3:15 pacers for until the Altrincham hills then try and push on in the second half. There were 4 3:15 pacers, 2 at the front then 2 behind so I positioned myself in the middle. At the big mile boards I started to check my pace band and compare to my watch and I was about 200m up on my GPS so the pace we were going off at was slightly fast but I had hit those paces on my MP runs so I wasn't too concerned about the pace.


The first 5km went by in a breeze, at the first water stop it was quite chaotic but I grabbed a water bottle and took my first gel. I made sure to keep my water bottle until the next water station since it was getting quite warm. 


Up until half way it was rinse and repeat, chuck old bottle, gel, new water and I slowly worked my way up to be with the lead 3:15 pacers as we entered Altrincham. I knew from online that the hills in Altrincham were bad but since I'm from Belfast I was prepared for them as the hill in Belfast marathon is twice as bad! So I was prepared for them. I took it easy up over the hills then as we were leaving Altrincham I slowly left the pacers. From the elevation profile I saw that until the end it was just a slow incline so I knew I couldn't push too hard and at the halfway mark I could definitely feel the heat creeping up.


This is where the original plan went out the window. I knew I had the fitness to push on but it just kept getting warmer and at mile 15 I started seeing people start to pull off to the side with cramp so my goal became to keep going and to slow down a touch to keep myself from overheating. 


There was fantastic support on this stretch of the route with people with garden hoses spraying people and people with extra water out on the course which really helped. They say the race begins at Mile 20 and that's definitely the case today. This is when I started to see people pull out due to the heat and my goal was just to finish the race. I had my heart set on 3:10 but I knew I had enough left in the tank and enough time banked that I could definitely go sub 3:15 so I soldiered on and just tried to focus on the finish.


The last 10k is pretty much a blur but the sun was out in full force and I was just focusing on the road in front of me. As we turned onto the finish straight I heard people around me groaning as it's a 600m finish straight but I willed myself on to pick up the pace and get over that line which I did in a time of 3:13:45 which was a 10:50 personal best


### Post-race
As soon as I crossed the line I was feeling really woozy and I knew I was dehydrated. Some amazing police officers held me up for 60 seconds so I could get my bearing and start drinking my water. The finish funnel was really long and took me about 10 minutes to slowly walk through picking up all the drinks I could. Once I got my medal, t-shirt, drinks and energy bar I headed straight to the Meet & Greet flags to wait on my family coming. I cleaned myself up with baby wipes and got into a pair of crocs since my feet were destroyed and we managed to get a outside table of Caffe Nero while we waited on my other family to finish running. 


I loved the atmosphere of Manchester Marathon and the support of the Altrincham, Timperly, Sale, Stretford and Chorlton were all amazing and having the finish in the city centre this time was definitely more supporter friendly. Although it's advertised as fast and flat there were some hills but nothing I would call ""major"". I was in the city centre until 5pm and it was still lively with supporters and runners which was nice to see. If you want a great marathon and don't get into London then I'd definitely recommend Manchester, apart from a couple minor gripes I would say it was quite well organised and the support was fantastic.


I was slightly disappointed in my time but I'm taking a couple weeks to recover and then in the summer I have some other goals to aim towards, mainly a sub 40min 10km but overall I'm happy with my time and when so many others either had to pull out or didn't get PBs today I'm grateful to of got a 10 minute PB

### Background
50M.

I've run my entire adult life. Run ~5 half marathons, numerous 5Ks. Typically ran 15-20 miles per week. I had found that if I ran more than 2 days in a row, I would develop overuse injuries.

More recently, I left the workforce to help out at home with my children and was able to focus more on my fitness. In the last 2 years I have incorporated more strength training into my regiment which in turn lead me to think about upping my mileage. 4 days of running, 4 days of lifting (2 on non-running day). I'd often do leisurely 30-45 minute zone 1-2 rides on the stationary bike on non-running days.

I ramped up to about 30 miles per week last spring/summer and ran the BAA half marathon in November in 1:47. Feeling confident in my health and ability to handle the load, I figured this was the time to try a marathon, given my work situation.

My family is involved in a charity that has a team and was accepted to the team for Boston. This would be my first marathon. A dream come true as someone who grew up watching the marathon and has lived on the course my entire adult life.  I raised about $12K from donors for my charity team. (For those unaware, Boston has about 3200 charity fundraisers in the field).

My initial goal was to finish and finish in under 4 hours.

### Training
I went into the training block in December at about 35 miles per week. I'd never done much speed/hills/tempo work before though I run on hills most days.

The plan from the team coach had me running 4x per week with 2 days of strength/cross-training. 1 long run, 1 recovery run, 1 hills repeats, 1 tempo.

The plan peaks at 50 mpw.

The Boston area charity teams have the advantage of training on the course. The long-runs almost always included the Newton hills on tired legs.

December to February I hit all the marks in training. Didn't miss a run. The first two 20 milers were a challenge but completed with with 8:15/mile and 8:30/mile pace.

March was a bit of a mess:
> I threw out my back at the gym in early March (root cause: weakness in my hips) which cost me a few days of running
> I had a previously planned vacation which provided limited opportunity for running (12 miles over 7 days of travel) near when my peak mileage should have occurred but I did as much cross training as I could.
> I came back and ran the peak week (22 miler, other 8-10 milers) and came down with some peroneal tendinitis which cost me a week of running (shout out to my PT and my new found love of acupuncture)

I blew up on that 22 miler in training. I had flown the previous day and hypothesized that I was under-nourished and dehydrated. I told myself that I would fix those problems for race day and that my performance would be closer to my other 20 mile training runs.

My major concern was fixing the problems from the 22 miler and managing the tendinitis.

I felt if I managed those two, I could conservatively run 8:30/mile splits like my first two 20 milers and meet my stretch goal at race time of 3:45.

### Pre-race
500g/day of carbs. Used skratch drink to augment solid carb sources.

Terrible night sleep, the night before. Was awoken at midnight and couldn't fall back to sleep until 3. Too anxious.

I was in the last wave so I arrived at bus pickup at 8:30, found my training partner, and mindlessly shuffled through the bus line. Somehow, we weren't really moving. We ended up on the very last bus at around 9:45, arriving in Hopkinton at 10:45. A quick visit to the porta potty and we immediately started the long walk to the starting line.

I was worried about eating given the 11:15 start for wave 4. I ate my usual bagel with PB and honey and a banana at 730am and then topped myself off with a piece of bread and a banana at the end of the bus ride.

We walked up to corral 2 and kept on walking and hit the start line. We didn't linger in the corrals at all, which caught me off guard. I had forgotten to tie my shoes well.


### Race
Again, plan was to run 8:30 min/mile (5:18min/km).

Race day was beautiful. Sunny, 60F, slight head wind much of the day.

Plan was to do huma gels at miles 3, 7, 10, 13, 17, 20, 23 and pretty much stuck to that, with the exception of skipping the last one. Just couldn't stomach it at that point. Washed down the gel with water. Did gatorade at one of the two water stops between gels.

Miles 1-2
Very crowded for first two miles. There was a huge range of paces in that corral. We did 8:45 min/mile which seemed fine. I was surprised just how steep that first mile is. My right shoe untied. DOH.

Miles 3-14
Laying the groundwork for my problems.

Mile 3-4 things started to clear out in terms of crowds. Some people walking at that point, probably on run/walk plans.

From there, me and my partner both were feeling good and ran 8:05-8:15. My heartrate was in the 140s so I told myself it was ok. BIG MISTAKE DUMMY. 

That said, the crowds were unbelievable through these miles. Framingham was great. Natick was awesome and the really loud. I could hear the scream tunnel from a half-mile away and the rest of the Wellesley crowds were super loud. Shout out to the guy in Wellesley with the absurd sign about his girlfriend.

By the big downhill in Wellesley, my quads were screaming. This had never happened in training. Despite all the hill work, usually the hard effort was going up.

I kind of knew I was in trouble at this point.

Miles 15-17
I hit the fire station and caught glimpse of my family which gave me a huge boost.  I was slowing down. 8:30 mins/mile. ""Which is fine! That's the plan"" I was telling myself.

Miles 17-21
The hills are a slog. I was yet another victim. Pace went into the 9's and never left that range until Boyleston St. My training partner had to start walking at around 18 and I left him behind.

Miles 21-26
Pace slips into the mid-9 mins/mile. The BC kids were really loud. Louder than the scream tunnel. Saw friends in Kenmore which was a big boost. 

But the entirety of Brookline and Boston was a grind. Hardest thing I've ever done. By this point my heart rate is in the 170s which is where I would go in training when doing max effort at the top of a hill.

I kept telling myself that I could make it under 4 hours if I just kept going. So I did.

Math wasn't my forte at this point but I looked at my watch at mile 25 and saw that it was something like 3 hrs 41 min. I just needed to hold on.


Mile 26
Once I survive the Mass Ave underpass hill, I got a final boost of energy. The right onto Hereford and then taking a left and emerging onto Boyleston St. is an experience I'll long treasure. I'm just a middle-aged dad living in the suburbs but all of a sudden I was running through the arena.

In the end, I met my primary goal (sub 4) with 10 minutes to spare. 3:50

### Post-race
Not many people are fortunate like me to do Boston as their first marathon. I am extremely grateful.

My legs after the race were wobbly and today (the day after), I'm extremely sore, especially my quads and calves.

The peroneal tendinitis was a total non-factor and barely hurts today.

Lessons learned I made as I first timer:
* Went too hard miles 3-15 and deviated from the plan too much. My heart rate wasn't a good guide there.
* Under-estimating the impact of the downhill nature of the first 14 miles of Boston. I had been warned but I don't think I really understood it. Would love to hear from experienced marathoners on how I should handle that
* I think I probably should have adjusted my plan to be something like 8:45/mile or 9 min/mile given the setbacks in March. I probably could have overcome one problem (the vacation) without major adjustment to the plan. Two injuries and the vacation was probably too much.
* I think my nutrition was good enough
* I should have worn sunscreen and a hat. Burned to a crisp today.
* I need to learn how to control my pace during training so I can follow training plans better with respect to long-run stretches at MP, etc.
* I proactively had a PT in place. He would do deep tissue massage every other week and helped keep me healthy at the beginning and helped me stay on top of issues like the tendinitis before it got out of control. There was never any hesitation about asking about an injury.
* I'd never run in a singlet until today. If you're hesitant, get over it. Between the singlet and the headwind, I generally stayed cool enough.

Very happy to have met the sub 4 hr goal. I wish it hadn't been in this way but I'll learn from it.

Overall, super grateful, happy, and thankful to everyone here who have done similar write ups to help me learn. Hopefully this is helpful to some future runner.

Any feedback or observations from folks would be much appreciated.

Next up? Recovery for a few weeks . . . then maybe a half? Seems like a much more civilized distance. Or maybe a flat marathon with pacers. Or both. Feels like I've learned so much that it would be a shame to stop.

### Background

29m, this was my eleventh marathon in eleven years. I only now feel like I’m getting the hang of it.  

To make a long story long - My pal and I got hit by the cut off in our BQ quest after setting a 2:55 PR at the Mountains 2 Beach in 2023. We were pissed off. We geared up to run Eugene 2024. In Jan 2024, I got hit with a hip flexor injury that was incredibly frustrating to deal with. I was on and off again all spring, until around April when I got back to reasonable running, but I didn’t make it back in time for that race. My pal crushed it at Eugene with a 2:53 but still got screwed by BAA later, those bozos! I pivoted to the Surfer’s Point marathon in Ventura in early September and began Pfitz 18/55 again in May. 

On a trip to Europe around that time, my wife and I found a cool gold chain. I decided to try it out, a bit of new fashion. I especially liked it running. It was one of those paperclip chains. A friend found a picture of Timothee Chalamet wearing one on a red carpet somewhere and it was the exact same style. It gave me confidence. It made me faster. May and June went great for training. Then, in late June, fiddling with my chain at my desk job, a link snapped. I was sad. But what I didn’t expect is that it would destroy my hopes and dreams again. I hit an epic long run that Saturday and realized later in the day that my calf had a small strain - and my hip flexor strain was back in full force. Shit! 

I went back to PT, very frustrated, and had to take a month off in the middle of training to recover both injuries. Training after that was very stop and start, lots of pain management and getting expectations back in check after a fraught cycle with some bonked long runs. I only had one or two weeks over 50 miles all summer. Also, training in the summer just sucks. I set a 10k PR on a solo time trial at 36:55 which gave me some confidence leading up to Surfer’s Point. That race went okay - I felt healthy for it, but just didn’t have a lot of juice. A massive heat wave came that week and it was probably 15 degrees hotter than I hoped too. I landed right at 3:00 and was proud because it was a brutal day, but I still knew I could go much faster. I had work to do. 


### Training

I didn’t take all that much time off after Surfer’s Point and got back up to around ~35 miles/week soon after. I keyed in on Ventura in February and started 18/55 over again, this time adding miles throughout the week and often an additional run, typically a 5-6 mile recovery on Sunday after my Saturday long run. I basically split the difference between the 18/55 and the 18/70 plan so that I maxed out at 65 miles / week and hit over 60 miles almost every week in January. I was surprised at how the added day and extra mileage felt - it wasn’t all that bad and I think the extra day actually made me feel better more often than not. 

Another important event happened in late November - at a holiday market in our town, we found a jewelry stand. My wife bought me another gold chain - a sturdier one. I wear it on every long or fast run and it has done wonders on me. With my gold PED, I hit two more 10k PRs (36:20 and then 35:44) a half marathon PR in training on the 18/14 race pace long run (1:23, I need to actually race one of these someday…) and more miles than I’d ever run in a month in January. I was feeling good going into the race, slight taper blues and some nervousness, but what else is new? 

The weather was shaping up to be a little bit of a hot one - I was hoping for a low in the high 30s or low 40s and a high in the mid 60s, but race day we had a low of 50 and a high of 80 in Ojai where the race started. Tough. 


### Pre-race

Saturday night, I ate pasta, watched Creed and got to bed early for 3:30 wake up before driving to the start on Sunday morning. Breakfast of coffee, Tailwind, a banana, and a superhero race day muffin from Run Fast Eat Slow. Got to the start line in Ojai at 5:30 for a 6:30 start and spent 50 minutes in line for the porta potty. There were probably 30 porta potties for a 1000 person race. It was a disaster, and by far the worst thing about the marathon planning. I didn’t even get to use a porta potty, at 6:20 I evacuated through other means which was sad but simply had to be done. 


### Race

It was a stressful start to the race, as I also wasn’t able to push through the crowds to get to the front so I started in wave 2, about 45 seconds after the first wave. I went out a little too fast, hitting 6:17 my first mile as I weaved around all the runners ahead of me. I tried to remain calm and find relaxation in the 6:25 - 6:30 zone as we cruised through Ojai and around some rolling hills to settle into the race. 

At around mile 8, the race leaves Ojai and starts dipping gently downhill. I was plugging away at the Tailwind I carried as well as Huma gels every 3-4 miles. My stomach felt a little off, but I pushed through it. Around this time I started grabbing water at aid stations and seeing if I could land the cups in the trash cans off a running toss. I was very happy each time I got one in, hitting to my count (which got hazier as the race went along) 4/6 or a 66% - that would be an amazing night shooting in the NBA. 

GI distress was getting slightly worse in the midsection of the race. I took the double caffeine Mocha Huma gel at mile 15, excited for the burst of caffeine - but I could barely get it down, and after sipping on some water I had to stop and heave. Luckily I didn’t actually throw anything up, but this was the lowest part of the race for me. Some runners passed and I probably lost ~8 seconds here from stopping, not counted in the splits since I accidentally stopped my watch. 

I got to recover with a big hill at mile 17 - this thing felt giant, but it weirdly gave my mind a good goal to push up it, and I started to see a pack of runners in my sights for the next few miles. I wanted to finish this race strong. My stomach troubles seemed to go away, and the caffeine from the mocha gel was hitting, there were portions of good shade and the downhill had everyone cruising. I remembered the chain around my neck and how cool I probably looked with it, and all the training it carried me through, and I began to believe I could hold on for the rest of the race. One mile at a time. I zeroed in on the pack ahead of me and kept pushing. 

The finish was a beast. It started getting really hot, and the one person that I didn’t catch in the pack really took off, so I felt pretty much alone out there in the last mile, besides the half marathoners nearby. 

I was proud of sticking strong, this was by far the best finish to a marathon I’ve had - mostly because I’ve bonked hard at the end of nearly every other race. I was pretty animated crossing the finish line. In my excitement, I fist pumped and accidentally spiked the water bottle the volunteers gave me and it smashed on the concrete spilling everywhere. I was immediately pretty embarrassed, but it is a fun memory. 


### Post-race

I hobbled to the waffle breakfast with my wife, friend, and dog (all separate people). Another runner gave me a hit of some of his Pepto Bismol - thanks dude! Two other people gave us their spare beer tickets. It was a glorious morning.

Not sure what’s next for me - I really enjoyed and was proud of this training cycle. I ran my first marathon 11 years ago and never could’ve imagined this type of result. This race definitely wasn’t perfect but it was by far my best race in terms of execution and training, so maybe there’s more mountains to climb and I can get even faster. I hope this time will get me into Boston 2026 but we’ll see.

### Training
After running a great marathon in 2021 (pandemic base FTW), I got injured enough that between rounds of PT, scans, doctor visits, and eventually surgery I was out for a year.  So in Spring 2022, coming back completely out of shape (and carrying some extra for the first time in a LONG time), I thought I'd give myself a year to get back in shape.  I've gotten back in shape that quick before, before I had kids, that should work, right?  Well I'd never been 40 before.  I did two marathon attempts in 2023 and they were both disasters, one DNF (heat contributed) and the other a 3:30+ when I was shooting for under 3:10, couldn't keep the pace at all after 4 miles.

I wanted to try and BQ before I age out of this age group (my birthday is a few weeks before Boston, and I'm 42 now), so I signed up for Hyannis (one of the last localish marathons before the window for 2026 closes in the fall), built BASE base miles, and then followed Hal Higdon's Intermediate 2 plan.  HH has gotten me to two BQ's, and I love that it's basically structured base work, with some race-pace tempo and that's it.  ""No need to train for a marathon like it's a 5k"" seems to be the philosophy, and it meshes well with my schedule; the longest mid-week run is 10 miles and there's no time-consuming repeats, etc.

### Pre-race
My sister-in-law was an absolute peach and swung by and took our kids for an overnight visit at their place, so I was able to have a completely relaxed afternoon with just my wife the day before, absolutely wonderful.  Like an overnight stay away from home in my own bed.

Morning of, I ate breakfast, pooped 3 times, and then my wife drove us dthe 45 minutes to get there (I love being able to drive to a race day-of).  Signed in, took another dump, and sat around getting in the mental state.  I had 6 gels, and would be taking water/gatorade on the course, that was the plan at least.  

The major sin I committed was wearing new gear; I have done the half here at least a dozen times over the years, and it was usually pretty warm.  This year it was 45-50F outside for the 6 days prior to the race, and then the forecase was for it to be about 25 on race day.  Dressing for running in the cold is hard enough, but racing in it is another thing.  I have one pair of tights, but they have no pockets, so I bought a new set of Nike Pro winter tights with two pockets.  

About 30 minutes before the race I went out to jog a little and take a final pee.  As soon as I stepped outside I saw the portapotty line and decided that took precendence.  Finally got to the front of the line with about 4 minutes to spare.  Thankfully, it wasn't just nerves, and I DID have significant piss, so it was worth it.  Dumped my warm-up gear and climbed throught the fence to close-ish to the front (not close enough, and there were a lot of 9 min/mile folks lined up in the wrong spot, it turns out).  

### Race
And we're off!  This race is primarily a half marathon (it's a 13.1 mile loop, the full marathon goes around twice), but there's also a 10k and a relay, all starting at the same time.  So there are a lot of people going out pretty quick.  I felt like I was starting pretty under control, but looked at my watch a minute or so in and it said 6:15 pace.  WTH!  My goal pace was flat 7-minute miles.  The super shoes and race day nerves must be messing with me.  In retrospect, I also had my watch set up poorly, I was just getting average pace for that mile and overall distance; I should have had it giving me mile splits and also had overall time.  It still felt easy though, so at least it wasn't what happened to me a couple years ago.  

The first few miles was pretty crowded, a lot of passing being passed.  It's a pretty turny course, so there's a lot of tangents to run, but for some reason people weren't really shooting for them.  Most of the course isn't closed to traffic, but it's a Sunday morning near the beach in early March, not exactly high season.  It was a very windy day (15mph with gusts to 20-25), and there's about 3 miles that go right along the water, but thankfully that was a cross wind so it wasn't too bad.  But it did go right in your face when you climbed the small hill getting away from the water.  Around 8 miles I started trying to take notes, because this was where it was really going to hurt when I came through the second time.  This is also the first time I made note of the most annoying runner out there with me (no offense I'm sure he's a great guy), but I could really hear the clomp-clomp-clomp of his footsteps and something was squeaking on him with every stride, might have been his shoes or his race number?  I don't know but it made him stick in my head.  He passed me and I was happy to let him go, but we yo-yoed a bit.

Coming through the half I still felt pretty good, I could feel my legs starting to let me know that they would be angry with me today; not a cramp warming, but a cramp watch was in effect.  Around this time I started to eat my gels more slowly, my stomach was starting to be a little upset with me.  I eventually stopped eating them and finished the race with two untouched.

Before 14 I passed Squeaky McClomperson who had stopped to vomit behind a telephone pole.  Thankfully he was quickly back in it and passed me again less than a half mile later and I said ""Hell yeah, boot and rally"" in encouragement.  

Back to the water, and it was bleak.  I was still hitting a solid pace, but it was starting to feel like work a little, and I knew the hills were coming.  When I got to the hills, the wind was coming so hard, my vision was pretty blurry.  I was having trouble seeing which way the people far ahead of me were turning, which made running tangents a challenge.  Glanced at my watch around 20 miles and pace was getting into the the expected range, but would not stay there.  I knew I had a solid cushion from the first lap, so I tried to keep it on, but these last few miles were a grind, as always.  Runner math came up, I was delighting in the fact that at 21 miles, I had about 20% of the race left, when I finished that mile I would have finished about 20% of what was left.  Around mile 24 I kind of hit a wall.  My cadence just couldn't be maintained.  I walked for about 10-15 seconds, and then started up again, pretty sure that was after a LONG false-flat.  Finally hitting 25 miles was so good.  I knew there was kind of a downhill in the last mile and I was really looking forward to it.  I had ditched my gloves in my pockets and was holding my hat, so my wife didn't realize it was me until I was nearly to her, but she seemed really excited when I passed her; I had no idea how I was doing because my watch was just giving me distance and pace, so I just tried to finish on empty (wasn't hard).  Finally saw an overall time on the clock at the line, and it said just over 3:02, which was a PR by less than a minute, so it was worth it!

### Post-race
A couple photos with the kids outside, then I went inside, got dressed, and was so cold and hungry.  I was shaking while sitting in dry clothes with a parka on, eating an oreo and an apple while drinking powerade.  About an hour later I was in good shape though, so that was nice.  Pulled pork sandwich with fries for a late lunch, and then a nice ride home.  

I still can't believe it worked.  I felt so bad in those last few miles, and those hills took so much.  A three-minute cushion is decent, but probably won't get me into Boston and I'm okay with that.  Next year I get 10 more minutes!

1frirvi,2024-09-28 16:58:38+00:00,TheRunningPianist,,Marathon_Training,/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1frirvi/if_you_want_marathon_time_predictions_dont_just/,"If you want marathon time predictions, don't just post your long runs. We need the following information too.","Reposting this information now that fall marathon season is getting underway. Anyway, if you want the best marathon time prediction we can offer, please provide the following:

1. **A time from a recent race.** The race should have been done at proper race effort (i.e., with the intent to do your best that day) and done within the past four to six weeks. *Half-marathons and 10-milers are best.* Although races of longer distances such as 30K have more predictive signal for a marathon time, those are rarer and not as ideal during marathon training as they take much longer to recover from. Races shorter than 10K involve different physiological systems and are not as good for assessing fitness for a marathon. Time trials can substitute actual races if need be. However, they cannot replicate the conditions of actually being in an official race. And if you don't have this, even an estimate of your current half-marathon or 10-miler time would be better than nothing.
2. **Your weekly mileage during your training and what kind of runs you were doing.** Report the number of miles or kilometers you run on a typical week during training as well as your maximum. Did you include tempo runs? Did you regularly include a mid-week mini-long run? Did you have several long runs lasting longer than two hours? Runners with higher mileage and more balance in their training (e.g., running six days a week with a tempo run on Tuesday, a mini-long run of nine to twelve miles on Thursday, a long run on Sunday, and recover runs of three to five miles on every other day as opposed to someone who does one long run on Sunday and two short runs during the week) will be more prepared and are more likely to be able to handle a more aggressive marathon target time.
3. **Your running history, including the number of marathons you have run before.** Newer runners and those about to do their first marathon should target a more conservative time. Experience helps a lot, both in terms of endurance and being able to handle the last miles of a marathon.
4. **Any significant interruptions in your training.** I’m not talking about a flu that made you miss four or five days of training or your inability to complete a few long runs because life got in the way (even if it was your 20-miler you missed). I’m talking about things that prevented you from running for weeks during training like a serious injury or illness or major disruptive life event. Obviously, if you had such interruptions, you would want to think about a much more conservative time, or even freeing yourself from any time goals and simply focusing on finishing.
5. **If you’re naturally more inclined toward endurance or speed.** If you’re one of those people who can run a 3:11 marathon despite a 1:34 recent half-marathon, let us know so we don’t have to be as conservative with your time predictions.
6. **What race you’re running.** Also include information about whether the course is flat or hilly and the typical race day weather is. Many of us would give different race time predictions if you were running Shamrock or Chicago than we would if you were running Baltimore or Austin.
7. **Any stretch goals you have.** If you want to break three hours and you’re unsure if you can but you’re willing to take the risk of an implosion in the later miles, let us know. We can tell you if your goal is difficult but plausible or if it’s completely unrealistic.

Basically, these provide information about your current fitness level and factors such as the quality of your training, your experience level, and the race you’re doing in order to help us adjust the prediction of your marathon time as appropriate.

**Meanwhile, here are some things that are much less useful. Feel free to include them if you want, but if I were reading your post to help you determine an appropriate marathon target time, most likely I will gloss over these things.**

* **Your long run paces.** We would have reason to be concerned if none of your long runs lasted more than 90 minutes or fourteen miles, but since these runs should largely be done at an easy pace, they are not a good assessment of your current fitness. While it is true that faster runners tend to run their long runs faster, running your long runs at X pace will not cause you to complete your marathon in Y time. In fact, runners who do their long runs faster than what their fitness dictates could end up running themselves down and shortchanging the development of their endurance. Similarly, not running your long runs faster than X pace does not mean you will fail to run your marathon in Y time.
* **The results of your Yasso 800s workout.** Similar reasoning—a runner than can do a marathon in three hours should be able to do ten 800 meter repeats in three minutes each, but being able to do ten 800 meter repeats in three minutes each does not necessarily mean the runner will complete the marathon in three hours, particularly if his endurance is lacking. This is a good workout, but as a marathon time predictor, it isn’t particularly useful. I would actually go as far as to say that paces in any workout are not good assessments of current fitness for the same reasons. *So yes, a half-marathon race time is a better predictor than a 21-mile long run.*
* **Marathon pace segments in long runs.** Marathon pace runs can fail for numerous reasons other than lack of fitness such as weather conditions or residual fatigue in your legs. I’ve personally failed marathon pace runs yet did not adjust my race goals on marathon day and still did fine. Marathon pace runs may be good for getting your body used to that pace, but they are generally not done at the extent of your capabilities and thus are not a good indicator of your current fitness.
* **How close to the actual marathon distance you ran during training.** I have run six BQs without ever running more than 20 or 21 miles during my long runs. Other people have run faster times without exceeding 21 miles as well. Meanwhile, I know several people who have gone up to 24 or 25 miles and it still didn’t really help them. Actually, a 25-miler may even be counterproductive as it will often require noticeably more recovery time, especially if you're not someone who can run a 5K in 17:30 or faster.
* **Your age and gender.** Age and gender can be a proxy for mileage and training. If a 28-year-old and a 58-year-old have the same half-marathon time, it is safe to assume the 58-year-old ran more miles and had higher quality training and thus will be better prepared and able to handle a more aggressive target time. Similarly, if a man and a woman have the same half-marathon time, it is safe to assume the woman ran more miles and had higher quality training. But once I know the crucial information from above, age and gender don’t really contribute any additional information. I generally ignore age and gender once I know recent race times, training, and experience level."

### Training
This was my 4th marathon. I originally planned on running the Carmel Marathon a week prior. More on that below, but that meant I had an extra week of taper that I winged, replicating my final week of taper. After my fall race (2:58) I took some time off before slowly building back up. By December I was back around 40-45 miles a week, all easy runs. Training kicked off properly in January with my club where I began at 50 miles a week and maintained 50-60 for the block, doing 6 days on and 1 speed session a week. I peaked at 70 miles which is about the most I’m willing to do, I don’t think I’ll ever want to put in the time for doubles and 80+ mile weeks. Winter was unusually snowy in Central Ohio so I had several days swapping a run for an indoor session on my bike. Eventually I bought a gym membership and ended up doing a decent amount on the Dreadmill.

The block went great, I was consistently leading workouts with my group for the first time and no workout ever left me feeling drained. I did have 2 injury scares. For about 6 weeks I managed some adductor pain, eventually I took 3 days off and saw a physio. Rest did the trick, the pain was gone by the time I got to my appointment. During taper I had knee pain but that late in the season I knew there was no point In fighting it, so again, I rested for 3-4 days and it was gone.

The block culminated in a 22 mile workout my coach devised. I set a half marathon PR during it and felt incredible, a huge confidence boost. Shortly after my coach put in my ear that I could probably run somewhere in the 2:40s which I scoffed at. But it stuck with me and I realized I could aim higher than 2:55.

### Pre-race
I had a great taper and did a 3 day carb load, travelled to Indiana for Carmel on April 19th. I knew it would be a rainy race. I woke up at 5AM and started fueling while I checked my notifications. The race was cancelled due to severe thunderstorms. I scrambled and decided to register for Glass City the following week. We drove home and I ran a tempo 13 miles that afternoon to blow off steam. I’m a planner so the spontaneity of Glass City threw my mental for a loop. I began my carb load again on Thursday. By the time we got to Toledo on Saturday I was feeling confident and calm again now that the race was finally here.

### Race
The weather was PERFECT. 40 degrees at the start line, clear skies, no wind, ended up in the low 50s when I finished. It’s honestly the race I remember the least of, the miles flew by and I kinda feel like I blacked out. The course crowd was sparse and had no notable scenery. I started the first 5k slower than my planned pace to make sure I stayed controlled, this is a strategy I’ve done in the past. Eventually I hooked onto the heels of 2 elite women who were knocking off 6:30s like clockwork. I had a pee stop at mile 8 and then hustled to reel that pair of women back in quickly since they were pacing me so well. At the halfway point I felt great and was tracking well. Shortly after seeing my wife I sent a voice text to her to tell her I saw 2 cute dachshunds (we have a dachshund so this was important news), and this somehow killed my Apple Watch. This shook me more than it should’ve, but I was pissed that my watch died. It miraculously came back on and continued the workout but the mile split was messed up (I guessed in the splits above) and was about .4 miles off. This might’ve been the final straw before I get a proper watch.

My nutrition plan was to take 5 honey stinger gels, one every 5 miles and I continually sipped on my Skratch super hi carb mix which was about 70g carbs. I took no water or fuel from aid stations.

Around mile 16 a runner caught me and matched my pace. We stayed together until mile 19 when he slowly pulled away, at this point I had people in sight but no one to pace off of. Around 21, I caught a guy who was a physical specimen so I just assumed he was faster than me. I stayed on his heels for a mile or so until one of his friends cheered him on for going sub-3, at that point I saw I was running a 6:45 and had to get my ass back in gear. With 5k to go I started to chip away at my pace, knowing there was a slim chance I could sneak under 2:50. This part of the race is a bike path with no crowd support, I wasn’t able to hold that faster pace but I kept trying to push. But all told I never hit a wall or struggled, I had minimal muscle fatigue throughout. At 25.5 the race was on and guys were making their final pushes so I tried to stay on their heels as they passed. I passed a good 8-10 people in the final 1K. We finished in a football stadium which was pretty cool. I let out an audible fuck yeah as I crossed the line.

### Post-race
By far the best I’ve ever felt during or after a race. We had to walk maybe .5 mile to the car which felt good. I had a bagel and water in the car ride for 2 hours to Columbus. Then I destroyed some Canes chicken fingers and took a hot bath. Legs are sore but stairs are surprisingly easy. I’m writing this after walking to a bar for a couple beers. We’ll see how tomorrow feels.

I’m so happy with the result. A BQ is awesome but I don’t know that I have a strong desire to do Boston in the next few years. I really want to do Chicago and NYC and this time gets me entry to both. My first marathon was Fall of 2023 and was a 3:22, I’m honestly in disbelief that I shaved off 32 minutes in 2 years but this race has taught me to stop limiting myself mentally. I got into Berlin via a lottery from my run club, so all eyes are on that for the fall and I think I’ll target 2:45 and see what happens!

# Background

Yes, I (M51) had one and only one goal, break 3:30. No B or C goals, just that one goal.

This was my sixth marathon. In 2022, I ran 3:30:49 at Mo Cowbell. Cramping up in the last 2 miles, I narrowly missed 3:30, not understanding yet that I should expect every marathon to run a little long on distance. But I figured I would have to do better my next race.

What followed was [an injury and DNF at Go! St Louis in 2023](https://www.strava.com/activities/8819599492). A nasty cramp in mile 18 at [St George 2023](https://www.strava.com/activities/9995752723) while on a 3:25 pace for a 3:45 finish. A comeback race on a hot day at [Greater St Louis 2024](https://www.strava.com/activities/11276670227) with a 3:35:15 (below my goal of 3:36:28) and top 10% in my AG.

On September 28, I ran [the Belleville Main Street marathon](https://www.strava.com/activities/12524941488/overview), trying out my 3:30 strategy. The heat was an issue, but three portapotty trips were a bigger problem as I still pulled a 3:31:53 and an AG 2nd.

# Training

Leading up the Belleville, I trained with Fleet Fleet RC St Louis. I strarted from a consistent off-season base of 35-40 mpw with lots of 5k-10k races. Belleville Marathon training block was 10 weeks averaging 50 mpw with a peak of 65 miles followed by a 2 week taper to Belleville. This block included the 6 hr Watershed Endurance Runs at week 5, basically a 34 mile run at about a minute slower than my long run pace. Longest run (besides the 6 hrs) was 20 miles in week 10.

I then did only a week of recovery before jumping back into a second 6 week St Jude training block averaging 57 mpw with three 20-mile runs and a peak of 70 miles before a 3 week taper. I was at a total of 1055 miles over 22 weeks by the day of St Jude. I did a total of 4x 20-mile runs plus the Watershed runs and Belleville.

My weekly schedule was roughly 6-9 mile easy Monday and Wednesday, speed work Tuesday (3mi short intervals) and Sunday (6-8 miles long intervals race pace or faster), 60-80 minutes best aerobic effort Thursday, 12-20 miles long run Saturday.

# Pre-race

I started carb loading Wednesday, aiming for roughly 750g, drinking a lot of gatorade! Got a ride down from Edwardsville, IL, to Memphis during the day Friday. Race temperatures projected to start at 32F up to \~50F. I did most of last taper week runs outside in sub-freezing temperatures in short sleeves and shirt, so I planned to race from the start in the same plus thin gloves with hand warmers. I gear checked my warmups about 10 minutes before the race. I had no issues with being too cold on the course doing this.

Unfortunately, the corrals were jammed and I gave up trying to make my way up to corral 3 and instead started back in corral 7.

# Race

**Mile 0-3**

Early on, I did a ton of weaving, starting back in a slower corral. By mile 6, I was already at +0.2mi for distance! I tried to stay focused on good tangents and lines throughout the race because of that. Although my watch splits look good, I was considerably slower on course splits because of the weaving and did not ease into my pace as well as I would have liked.

**Mile 3-11**

Course continued to stay jammed until the half marathon split. I stayed very steady in the 7:50-8:00 range, a little below my target 8:00 pace early but comfortable. My lap average heart rates were amazingly steady, ranging from 159-161 this whole time! I did figure out that the gun time clocks on the course were almost exactly 10 minutes behind my watch start time, which was very helpful.

**Mile 11-18**

With the course emptied out from the split, I started focusing more on hitting tangents and good lines while keeping my pace steady. Strangely, I had yet to see even the 4:00 pacer, much less any of the sub-4 pacers. More on this later. After mile 13, I started working towards a negative split, dropping 3 straight sub-7:50 miles while dipping my heart rate every so slightly down to 157.

**Mile 18-24**

Mile 18 had the longest climb of the course. Only 60 feet, but I struggled a little and slowed to an 8:13 but didn't budge my heart rate. My right quad was noticeably painful at this point, but my calves were fine and that's where I normally cramp first. Although I was hoping for more negative splits, I did stay very solidly around 8:00 after mile 18. Around mile 21, I started experiencing slight cardiac drift, moving steadily from 161 up to 164 by mile 24.

The interesting motivation I had during this stretch is I started to catch up with pacers, first the 4:00, then 3:55, then 3:50. I figured, given the corral stagger, that I needed to be about a minute ahead of the 3:35 pacers at the finish to hit 3:30. But I am running a 3:30 pace and I'm only 10 minutes behind gun time and have yet to see even the 3:45 pacers!! 

**Mile 24-Finish**

The last two miles were hard, especially mile 25. It just felt like an unending series of little 10-20 foot climbs. Each climb, my pace dipped considerably, going well over 9:15 pace on the climb up the ramp at the mile 25 marker. I seemed to have more than a 60 second cushion though, so as like as I could push back under 8:00 I knew I was good.

During mile 24 though, is when something really strange happened. At one point, I could see three different pacer groups in one straight stretch on Union Parkway. Here we are with less than 3 miles to go, and three different pacers (all sub-10 paces) are all somehow within a half mile of each other, and I still have not caught the 3:45 pacers!

I did briefly catch sight of the 3:35 pacers pushing up the ramp at mile 25 and thought I was going to catch them. Instead, they pulled away from me the of the race.  Another two hills later, I rounded the bend onto Union Ave and I could see the finish line less than 300m ahead on a straight downhill with 90 seconds left! To say I found another gear is an understatement. I ran the next 200m at sub-7:30 as I accelerated down the hill and pushed home the last 100m at sub-7:00 pace to finish with a 3:29:41 and hit my goal and PR!

And those 3:35 pacers? Nowhere in sight. 

# Post-race

I staggered through the finisher chute and made it three rows into Autozone Stadium before I sat down for 30 minutes :D Not only did I get my PR, but I took home 8th in my AG out of 101 runners and 176th out of 1846 overall.

As a side note, I later found out that our team passed $130k raised *during the marathon* and hit our yearly fundraising goal too! I could barely move most of Saturday and Sunday and will definitely finally be resting after this long season!

Year totals

For the year, I ran 3x marathons, 1x ultra, a total (so far) of 2180 miles while setting 50k, marathon, 10k, and 5k race PRs. (Maybe I need to fit a half in here at the very end of the year?) For now, I am going to focus on establishing a 50mpw base to start next year and see if I can hit 2500 miles while I think about my next marathon goals.

Training Background: 

Chubby 55yo M, never ran in my entire life untill April this year, mostly 3 \\\~ 4 times a week, started real slow, made it up to 44 miles the week before amonst work, house chores & taking care of 2 puppies.



Pre-race 

I arrived at Vegas on Saturday the day before the race, it was a bit hectic trip. The air was cold and dry in Las Vegas, I did a 2 miles shake out run around the Fremont St, the weed smell almost choked me, lol.



I had trouble getting sleep because it's my first marathon, to make matters worse, we all had to get onto the bus by 3:30am, so I only got 3 hours sleep.



Race 

The race started at Sandstone Quarry lookout place up in the mountains, it was 43F with 35mph gusty wind, the 5XL cheapo sweater saved my ass, as 2400 runners tried to hide behind the porta-potties, rocks & bushes.  Every min I could feel the glycogen draining out of my feet.



At 6:00am sharp, the race started right on time.



The first 8 miles were downhill all the way, I kept an eye on my heartate, holding it at 140bpm \\\~ 143bpm, it was a steady 8:15/mile.



Around 10mile mark, once we hit Summerlin downtown, the air felt a lot nicer, loved the cheering crowds & volunteers; we had plenty water, gatorade at every 2 mile interval.



Up untill Mile 20, I was running conformtably at 7:55/min; then I felt a tinge of pain in my quads, I ate a few salt sticks at water station, the pain eased a bit.



My real trouble was Mile 21, by then we are on Charlston Blvd in Vegas, even it was city & flat, there were still wind gusts, there was one part of the course we had to run up a long ramp, that totally killed my momentum. My paced went down to 8:15/mile immediately, at that moment, I started to have doubt on myself.



I definitely hit some kind of wall.



The mile 24\~ 26 were a total blur, I forgot what I was thinking & just wanted to finish the race.



Finally I saw the finish line, at that moment, I sprinted to the finish line.



Final time was 3:38:17, my garmin watch showed 26:36miles.



Post-race Lessons learned:



(1) Study the race day weather, cold temperature can be a double-edged sword.



(2) Do more bench press & weight trainnings.



(3) Should have eaten 2 more gels, when it was so cold.



I have learned so much from this sub-reddit, thanks guys for anwering my dumb questions."

While I'm happy that I have accomplished the distance, the experience was... not what I expected.

For context, I've been training hard for 16+ weeks, following a Runna plan that projected a 3:02-3:10 finish. My training went well, and I felt confident after a 39:35 10k in Cambridge and several sub-1:30 half marathons.

However, the marathon distance humbled me. Big time.

Three weeks out, I picked up Distal Posterior Tibial Tendonitis injury after a 31k training run. I switched to cycling and elliptical, hoping to maintain fitness, but I think it negatively impacted my running. To add insult to injury, I caught a mild cold the week before the race.

The pre-race logistics were a bit of a nightmare, for which I feel I am partly to blame. I flew in early the day before, rushed to check in, eat, and then spent over 3 hours getting to the expo for my bib. All this time I knew in my mind that I was spending far too long on my feet. To top it off, there was a mix-up with my bib, meaning my friends and family couldn't track me with a new number I was given. I had a crap nights sleep and my Garmin kindly showed me that my HRV dropped into the red that morning - thankfully I didn't check this *before* the race.

As for the race, something felt off right from the start. My heart rate was 165+ at 4:37/km pace, which I usually site comfortably at around 150. I put it down to the race excitement, ignored the warning signs and hit the halfway mark at 1:37. By 26k, I knew I was in trouble. Then came the cramps. Unprecedented, soul-crushing cramps, especially in my quads. The last 17k was a blur of walking, running, and sheer mental battle. I barely remember the last 5k. Crossing the finish line was pure relief.

I know 3:28:54 is a respectable time for a first marathon, but I can't shake the disappointment of missing my target. All the training, the sacrifices, and the sheer agony of the race... it's making me seriously question if I'll ever do another marathon.

The reality is that I fully expect I will lose the bet I made with my girlfriend that I will never run one again and the search will begin in a matter of weeks..."

First, please note this race happened almost 5 weeks ago. I thought it's only fair to give something back to this community considering how much I've learnt from here. If you have any questions or think you could benefit from any further insights into my experience, please ask in the comments. I'll be very happy to help!

# Context

M31 from Spain. Even though I always enjoyed running, I never got too much into it. Got the itch of running a marathon at some point during the 2020s lockdowns, but first a pneumothorax and then pure procrastination delayed any effort in serious running until the summer of 2022, where I just thought I'd just sign up for one and force myself to train.

I prepared for it with some generic Runner's World plan blended with a Novice Hal Higdon one, and even though I understood very little about running, I really enjoyed the training and went on to finish my first marathon in 3:40 - aim was 3:30 but I guess I met the wall!

Came back the following year (2024) with a target of 3:20 which ended up in 3:21. For this one I bought the Pfitz book and got more invested into the preparation, which was also very much enriched by many of your threads here in r/AdvancedRunning. Anyway, I was probably strong enough to reach my target but I simply overdid my negative split strategy (lol) and ended up with a nice PR but feeling I just left too much on the table.

In hindsight, this was a great thing to happen: it turned running into a very welcome obsession, and then came the preparation for this year's race.

# Training

**Key summary:**

* **Individual characteristics:** 31 year-old male, 1.83m 73kg (race week)
* **Previous PR:** 03:20:56 in Feb-2024
* **Training block length:** 12 weeks
* **Average distance:** 93 km (weekly)
* **Peak distance:** 105 km (week 9)

As I felt increasingly stronger coming back from the summer and even after a 3-week break between wedding preparation and honeymoon, I thought I could give sub-3 a serious try. If my shape somehow didn't get there, I could always dial the target back to a decent PB - which coming from 3:21 should be fairly feasible anyway.

Trying to make this report useful to others in a similar situation, I'll start by simply listing what I changed in the last year, beginning with the ones I find more generally accepted to be positive for anyone, then ending with some odd ones.

(1) Distance: very obvious one, I know. I went from a 60km weekly average in my previous plan to in excess of 90k this time. So a >50% increase while incredibly remaining injury-free

(2) Training with others: this was completely new for me and proved to be a game changer. I signed up with a local club and was very lucky to find a couple pals chasing a similar goal, and one of them coincidentally in the very same race

(3) Strength training: in the summer heat I found refuge in the air conditioned gym while slightly neglecting my running, making it some sort of 'pre-season' for my marathon cycle which also made me gain almost 10% in body weight. And while this surely hampered my summer running fitness, it's probably helped me remain injury free later in the year, with my highest mileage ever

(4) Variety: following the quality sessions prescribed by the club coach surely had its downsides (see below) but it helped me break free from my previous overly-regimented approach, which basically had me only doing 5 types of workouts and just varying distances

(6) Diet: I decided to go vegetarian right after the summer, and while this obviously isn't necessarily good for performance by itself, it made me pay much more attention to what I eat. Together with Fitzgerald's book, I got to race day in my leanest ever

Training structure was generally as follows, sometimes with a medium-long run on Mon/Wed:

* Monday: easy run + short strength session
* Tuesday: quality session (club run)
* Wednesday: easy run
* Thursday: quality session (club run)
* Friday: easy run or rest
* Saturday: easy run (or 1st part of split long run)
* Sunday: long run (or 2nd part of split long run)

Quality sessions included all kinds of stuff: intervals, track reps, fartleks, tempos, hills... while the weekend long runs were either split in two between saturday and sunday, or just one session including marathon pace. A couple weekends I exceeded the marathon distance, but my longest run in the plan was barely above 31km long.

The marathon plan itself began in the first week of December, making it 12 weeks long. Weekly distance was between 75 and 103 km, with an average of 93. I did a half marathon by the end of January which was a huge confidence boost, as I hit just below 1h24m - giving me a VDOT projection of sub-3 just before cutting my mileage ahead of the race.

As I mentioned above, running with a club was great but it made me discover how aggressive the approach of an old-school coach can be. Sometimes enjoyable, but also at some points I really wondered whether I was peaking too soon and risking injory. Some of the most brutal workouts were:

10 weeks before the marathon: 3x3K + 4x400m at something slightly faster than threshold pace 6 weeks before the marathon: 30x300m at \~mile pace with 100m walk recovery, in the track - I must admit I enjoyed it 6 weeks before the marathon (yes, that same one...): 25km long run on Sunday with 16km at marathon pace (4'15""/km) following a progression + hills session (12km total) on Saturday 10 days before the marathon: 2x6K first one at Marathon pace (4'15""), second one all out (3'48"" average) - a classic cornerstone of Spanish athletics, this is called the Gavela test and I personally think it's a really bad idea. That's what tune races are for, right?!

# Pre-race

Worth mentioning I am from Seville myself and my parents still live there, so pre-race accommodation is as easy as can be. It is advertised as Europe's flattest marathon, and indeed the course feels very forgiving.

On race week I followed Matt Fitzgerald's protocol for caffeine fasting from Monday, which seemed like low hanging fruit considering I'm a big time coffee drinker. Nothing too relevant apart from that, just stuff I believe to be common sense: avoided alcohol, tried going to sleep reasonably early and had the healthiest possible diet. I also tried to not overdo carbs until Friday, but to be honest I think >50% of my calories came from carbs everyday anyway.

I had the Maurten marathon pack and tried to make use of most of it. On Saturday, I had a typical Sevillian plate consisting mostly of chickpeas and spinach for lunch, while dinner was a pizza. During the day I also snacked a couple bananas and oranges, a Maurten 320 drink mix and a Maurten solid bar. So my carbo-load wasn't actually that different from what I would've had on a normal weekend.

I had an awful pre-race night's sleep: I don't think I fell asleep before 2:30 due to silly nervousness, and my alarm was set for 6:40. I believe this only highlights how important it is to have proper rest the days -and possibly weeks- leading to a big race - especially for those who tend to be nervous. Also, next time I might just use some sleep pill and forget about it, because this was very annoying to deal with.

Woke up with the alarm sound, and I just felt relieved the night was finally over and I didn't feel tired. My breakfast was a large espresso (finally, coffee!), a white bread toast with some olive oil and a Maurten 160 drink mix. Left my parents' at 7:20 and took the metro, arriving at the starting line area around 8:00.

Did a very light warm-up with just one \~50m stride if I recall correctly, then I met my pals and we passed the pre-race control around 15 minutes before, as our side of the entry was a bit crowded. Got over with the customary pre-race pee and went straight to my starting box, which for some reason was the 3h15-3h30 one. Race staff wouldn't allow me into the 3h one and I was just resigned to comply, but my friends were very insistent for me to just crouch underneath the barricade tape, and I would end up thanking them for this.

I had a Maurten 160 gel right as we heard the starting pistol for the elites and jogged towards the starting line.

# Race

Any remorse about my starting box transgression quickly disappeared as we ran the first kilometer. We had to overtake hundreds of people that were surely running slower than the 3h-3h15m paces, and it was just very crowded in general. My watch already had something like 70m in additional distance as I was passing the official 1K mark.

We made it a priority to get within sight of the sub-3 pacer relatively soon, as we reckoned they had crossed the starting line something like half a minute before us. But we already hit the target pace in the second kilometer, which was reassuring, and reapproached it as just shaving a couple seconds per km when possible and see.

Had my first gel at the 9th kilometer as planned, shortly before the second aid station. Maurten explicitly advertises you don't need water to wash down their gels, but it's something I struggle with and I was keen to make it as easy as possible. Given the relatively high temperatures, the strategy was to take a cup of sports drink in every station if possible, which I managed to do 7/8 times.

Saw my wife on the 13th kilometer - felt a bit bad about how brief every time I saw her was, but obviously it's supposed to be like this in a race! She walked something like 8 kilometers during the race to see me in four different spots, so definitely quite awesome from her side as well! She offered an extra gel every time, but I only ended up taking two.

We had a very steady run up until the half marathon mark, getting within \~100m of the sub-3 pacer by then. At this point there was very little to get anxious about: everything was coming together, the weather was perfect, crowds were very supportive... My only concern left was to avoid getting too excited until the final few kilometers.

Thankfully we played it on the cautious side, as things looked quite different from kilometer 34 onwards. I began to feel my right thigh a bit, which brought intrusive thoughts of whether I was going to make it, and even doing calculations in my head of how I'd end up if I were to drop to my easy pace (\~5min/km) at some point. The last gel felt pretty much impossible to swallow - this is something I should probably practice more in training, because it was the same in my January half marathon.

We still managed to push the pace, and I really felt the boost in confidence of seeing the first marker starting with a 4 by the cathedral. By then we were right by the sub-3 pacers, which were carrying a bit less people than I imagined. I last saw my wife in one of my favourite avenues of the city, which also happens to be the coolest part of the race as it comprises the last couple hundred meters of kilometer 42. She told me I was doing great, and indeed I saw this when I completed the last turn and saw the timer showing 2:59:3X.

I knew I had a bit of a buffer for a sub-3 real time, but I obviously went all out in those last meters to also try and have an official time below 3 hours... and even that came together pretty awesomely, as I crossed the line while the clock showed 2:59:59 - paired with an unbelievable 2:58:53 in real terms.

# Post-race

It was obviously my best race ever, and there's something about the whole prep process that made this one feel really special - particularly how unlikely a sub-3 looked a few months before. The race itself went close to perfection, something I feel lucky for considering the long list of things that can go wrong in a marathon race.

I must admit I caught myself wondering how much I could have shaved off my time if I pushed the pace earlier than kilometer 40. Maybe half a minute or even more, but never worth the risk of getting hurt at that point.

Wherever I read about it, the prospect from >3h20 to sub-3h was unanimously discouraged. Obviously context is key, as my previous PB had come off worse fitness and lesser focus overall. But I still like to think it was a great achievement to improve so much in a few months.

Also, I cannot recommend the Seville marathon enough. I'm obviously biased having been born and raised there, but I really think there's hardly any reason for a non-pro runner to favour Valencia over it.

Looking at what's next: I think I'd like to get faster in shorter distances like 5K and 10K, then maybe have a go at proper qualifying times for World Majors - though Berlin's 2h45 feels outrageous to ever think of, in terms of VDOT it's not as far as this one was from my previous PB.

**Racing history**

I (now 39F) started running for fitness in college but my dad kept signing me up for half-marathons and we'd go do them together (he's now 82 and still at it). I don't even remember my times but pretty sure I never broke 1:30. In grad school I decided to do a full, raced San Fran in 3:24 and then attempted Boston but DNF'd right before the Newton Hills with a groin strain. My dad had flown up to watch me and then wound up pushing me to the airplane in a wheelchair. I recovered and ran Austin the next February in 3:19 then moved to Africa for awhile, came home, got married, had two babies and ran through it all (with the required breaks for babies) but with no races on the calendar. Fast forward a few years and I wanted to do the Gorge 50k for fun. In training for that, I ran a downhill half in 1:34 (Jan 2023). Gorge was insanely awesome and hard with tons of mud, snow, 5700 ft of climbing, the gamut, but I was happy to finish in 6:52. Then I decided I wanted to see if I could run a fast full.

**Training**

Used a combo of Pfitzinger 18/70 and Jack Daniels 2Q - meaning I got mileage from Pfitz and (adapted the) workouts from JD. I base trained all summer, working out a bit of sciatica from the 50k, and then started ramping up mileage and adding some quality in August once I was pain-free. I added mileage for 3 weeks and then took a down week throughout that time. I peaked at 92 miles and did 6 20+ mile runs. I used the Vdot app for my paces based on my 1:34 marathon and at the beginning of the cycle, marathon pace felt super hard but by the end it actually felt somewhat sustainable. I told myself that with a proper taper and carbload, anything was possible. Vdot predicted I could do 3:16 and I was giving myself a stretch goal of 3:15. I picked up a pretty bad cough right after Christmas that was keeping me awake at night but I didn't feel super fatigued or anything. Just plugging along.

**Pre-race**

The week before the race, my sister realized her hamstring tightness wasn't going away. She and I had been planning our first-ever sister trip without kids to both run the Houston Marathon and after much PT-ing and praying and vitamin D taking, she decided she couldn't go. My sister-in-law was also running it so Saturday she decided to come hang with me at the hotel, which was really great. My husband was out of town on a men's retreat so my mom was keeping my girls (first time leaving them with someone besides my husband). I should mention, too, that I have done everything I could think of this cycle to get control of my GI issues but so far nothing has really worked. So the few days before the race while carb loading I was not eating anything remotely possibly triggering. Basically existing on rice and lean meat. The night before the race, I took 3 imodium and then the next morning I took 2 more (my sister about choked when I told her later. 'What happened to nothing new on race day?!?!?!?!'). NOT ADVISED. Apparently this can mess with your electrolyte and nutrient absorption and also cause some arrhythmia.

Slept like a sleep-trained baby and got up at 4:30 to drink my pre-workout (don't hate me), a thing of Liquid IV, and eat a bowl of rice. My SIL walked over to the convention center to drop our bags and then I did a little jogging and basically one stride because we were nervous about getting to our corral on time.

**Race**

Started out feeling easy breezy. I was really trying to run by feel and therefore was all over the place those first several miles. Too slow, too fast, way too fast, just right, too slow again. But feeling really like I was just floating, holding myself back, enjoying the amazing crowds and the tour of H-town. I had taken half a caffeinated Maurten at the start line and then I took an SIS electrolyte gel every 4 miles. I also got water at every water station.

However. Going under an overpass at mile 10, I suddenly felt like my vision blurred and I thought I was going to fall over. I felt incredibly nauseated. I was like, Well you don't run with your stomach, you run with your legs, keep going. But it was really difficult to keep pace feeling like that. I pulled my foot off the accelerator and thought I could speed up again as I got going. I kept wanting to find someone to run with but couldn't get into the rhythm with anyone. I was punching signs that said ""tap for a power boost!"" and smiling (grimacing) and doing all my mantras but I basically just got slower and slower. My husband and my sister were texting me every few minutes and Siri was reading their texts into my AirPod and that kept me going. Every few miles I would feel nauseated and lightheaded to the point that I just wanted to quit but I knew I would regret it if I did. My sweet brother-in-law was at three different places with two of his kids and they screamed at me and cheered me on every time I passed. Then about mile 20 my parents-in-law were there jumping up and down and screaming. Makes me cry now just to think about it.

The crowd support was world-class and the course was wonderful except for that dang hill at mile 12. I would love to go back and pace the course better.

About mile 18 I just started counting. Count to 100 ten times, ok now count to 10 over and over. At mile 25 I started counting to 60 and I just did that, keeping time with my steps, til the finishing straightaway. I saw Kofuzi and shouted at him which gave me a boost. Then this kid passed me and said, You got it, and waved me up to run with him and I about lost it right there. Running is so special.

**Post-race**

My mother-in-law called me right when I got done and I so wanted to meet up with them but couldn't get out of the finishing chute. They herded us into the convention center where I found my SIL and then we met up with her husband, kids, and our parents-in-law. Very sweet. I was pretty wasted and just wanted to pass out but I took a shower and drove the three hours home to my girls instead! It's day three and I feel really good actually. First couple of days I felt ill. Just wanted to be in bed. But I'm going to try to do Pfitz's little four-week 'get back into it' plan so I jogged this morning and felt fantastic. It felt so good to be running again.

Not sure what I'll do next. Kind of would like some redemption. People keep saying 'hey that's amazing you qualified for Boston!' and it really is, but I really think I just wanted to do something amazing THIS cycle. And I feel like I bombed it because I was a dummy. But I still love running and I ain't injured so I'm super grateful for those things."

# Training

I followed the Pfitz 18/55 plan. Training went okay—I struggled with many minor injuries and missed some key runs because I was afraid of making them worse. In the future I definitely want to focus on more strength training, I think my body is too weak to hold up the mileage I’m doing.

# Pre-Race

Holy moly the week leading up to my race was pure hell lol. I was so anxious about my race I could hardly sleep on most nights and I was so sleep deprived and also just consumed by the taper crazies. Everything hurt all over my body and I thought for sure I wouldn’t be able to run or perform anywhere near my best. Towards the end of the week I had just accepted my fate and started thinking about my next marathon. Luckily this acceptance led me to have 2 nights of passable sleep before my race and I woke up on race day feeling… ok.

# Race

As my first marathon, I just want to say that I think I am already in love with this distance. All my shorter distance races are pure death and suffering, even with the half I’m running at near threshold pace and it’s hard to think about anything besides staying alive. Marathon pace however, felt amazing, relaxed, and honestly euphoric. I had a clear head and was able to interact with other runners and the crowd. I even found 2 other runners who stuck with me for over 20 miles of the race and we talked to each other—it made me so happy to bond with 2 strangers chasing the same goal with me. I feel like I could never do this under marathon pace; I would need to be locked in and fighting for survival. The course was absolutely beautiful and I will never forget watching the sunrise at mile 6 on the bright crimson Broadway Bridge. People say that sometimes mantras are important to help yourself mentally tough out the 26 miles, but quite frankly all I was thinking during the race was that I was having so much fun and I never wanted it to end. These 3 hours alone made all the grueling 4 months of training worth it, I just wished it would last forever…

My legs, however, did not concur with those thoughts LOL. Going into this race, all I was worried about was the infamous “wall” and I ended up doing a great job with fueling and nutrition and had plenty of energy; carb loaded well beforehand and took 6 gels during the race. I had avoided the wall, but I had a different obstacle waiting for me. With 4 miles to go I felt like I had the energy to run sub 6 splits for the rest of the race, but it was also at this point where I felt my right leg start to cramp up. It was crushing knowing that I had gas in the tank left to spare but I had to hold back to prevent my leg from cramping up hard and taking me out of the race fully. I shifted most of my energy to my left leg and ran with this awkward lopsided form for the remainder of the race, but managed to keep even splits because of the amount of energy I had left.

I’m pretty happy with how things turned out, even if I may have been able to finish a minute or two earlier without my cramp. Perfect races are few and far between, and I was able to finish with only minor obstacles along the way. I think cramping might be because of an electrolyte issue? I’ll probably carry some salt tablets with me or something in my next race. It could also just be due to volume shortage since I had missed some training. Those last 4 miles in uncharted territory are really scary.

# Post-Race Thoughts

Post race depression is already hitting. I probably need to rest for a week before getting back on my feet again, but what is life if not running? Heck, I wish I could race every week.

Got my sights set on a spring marathon already. My main goal looking forward is to get stronger before worrying about getting faster so that I can avoid injury and run more because nothing sucks more than not running. But getting faster would be nice too so I don’t have to worry about Boston cutoffs getting lowerat this point I’m not sure a 2:52:02 is going to cut it next year :(

Favorite sign/quote from today: “don’t run to add days to your life, run to add life to your days”"

**Training**

I qualified for Boston at the [Coast Guard Marathon](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1bzymub/race_report_2024_coast_guard_marathon_a_no_excuse/).  Due to some other travel, I did not sign up for a marathon in Fall of 2024.

Early Spring of 2025, I was hitting some pretty good paces in [DC Road Runner](https://www.dcroadrunners.org/) events, and decided the DC RockNRoll Half Marathon would be a good benchmark for pacing.  I crushed that Half (1:42) but took a strain in the right hamstring which turned to be a pulled hamstring, which affected my later training.  I was able to knock out a 20 miler and and some interval sessions but I definitely reduced volume trying to care for the hamstring.  The sports doc gave me some high powered NSAIDS which were helpful. 

**Pre-race**

We stayed at the College Club of Boston on Commonwealth which was optimally located less than half mile from the finish line, close to the Boston Public Gardens, Boston Common, Newberry Street and Beacon Hill.  We toured Beacon Hill, Boston Public Library, Boston Red Sox game and had a great brunch at the parents of Michael Scarlett in Cambridge.  We attended the Blessing of the Runners Easter Sunday Service at the Church of the Finish Line (Old South Church), which was a fantastic and memorable service.

The morning of the race, I took a banana, some protein bars and water, dropped my bag off right around the corner and arrived at the bus pick-up at 0745, which was 30 minutes before we were allowed.  That was a pain to wait all that time and not be allowed to get to the busses.

|  5|8:33|148 bpm|

Anyone who has run this course knows there is a huge downhill for the first five miles and that included me.  Hoped to stay at 8:45 pace but once again the course ran away from me.  I felt that I was going pretty hard here and took my first maurten gel at u/mile 3.5 because I was looking at the KM and not mile markers.  A portend for things to come and resolved to ‘run the mile I was in’ for the rest of the race.  Thinking I was in mile five and realizing I was in mile 3 was a small set-back but managed my way through it.  Even in these early miles I felt the twitch in the hamstrings.  There was so much joy among the runners for finally starting and running the race.

| 10|8:27|150 bpm|

Well since I hit that pace for the first five miles, I didn’t want to feel like I was trailing off.  Took Maurten gel just after mile 10 it went down easy with water.  Even though I was trying hard to pump the breaks, enthusiasm, fellow runners and the great weather kept me checking to ensure I was maintaining sub 8:30s.

| 13|8:24|153 bpm|
| 14|8:23|153 bpm|
| 15|8:40|153 bpm|

Here is where I knew it was going to be a tough running day, but also that I needed to rely on my training.  Took a Maurten just after mile 15.   Even though it is mostly downhill, there are stretches where there is a rise.  I could hear the Wellesley Cheer Tunnel about a half mile before it actually appeared, which made me a little emotional.  There was a lot of joy in this sector which once again made me realize I needed to slow down.

| 18|9:22|154 bpm|
| 19|9:07|153 bpm|
| 20|9:35|153 bpm|

Mile 16 has a significant downhill, which is then followed by the dreaded Newton Hills.  Reflecting upon the times during this section, they really are not that bad in retrospect.  I am keeping the pace, pumping my arms and maintaining pretty good momentum.  I saw Janet (Michael Scarlett’s mom) who was manning the mile 18 water station, which gave me a boost.

||
||
| 21|10:23|154 bpm|
| 22|9:17|152 bpm|
| 23|9:40|151 bpm|
| 24|9:48|152 bpm|
| 25|10:07|151 bpm|

Mile 21 is Heartbreak Hill, but I was pretty deep into the Pain cave at this point, repeating the mantra to “run the mile I was in”.  I took another Maurten as the downhill started.  The wheels started falling off the tracks here but there were some downhills and was able to maintain a little momentum.  The crowds here were really loud and helpful.  The Boston College crowd was quite boisterouse especially on the hill.  You can see the CITGO sign at about mile 22-23 here in the distance, but know that when you finally reach it, you have a mile to go.  I felt there were a lot of people passing me here, but I kept my legs moving.  It was a looong time between these two periods.  The MBTA trains were running a long and tooting their horns…my quads were screaming.

||
||
| 26|10:39|152 bpm|
| 27|3:47|153 bpm|

Right on Hereford, left on Boyleston.  There was an absolute scream tunnel as we approached this turn.  The little underpass before these turns was another pain item to manage.

**Post-race**

The race was a blur and I was delirious with Joy.  Slowly took a few photos, then Picked up my gear and went straight back to the College Club.  That night, we ate a nice dinner at the bar that inspired the TV series, Cheers, which was fun..

Next up is the Berlin Marathon in Fall of 2025.

I’m so happy to report my training cycle has come to an end after months of running, and overanalyzing alllll of my progress on the running subreddits! Really grateful for this sub for keeping it real with me when I needed it :)

I didn’t have a strict time goal for this race as I’d been dealing with a plethora of injuries the entire year; however, I tentatively aimed for 4:15-4:30 given my training paces.

So — I’m not unhappy at all! If anything, extremely happy I was able to run the race, as I was pretty concerned my Achilles problems would prevent me from doing so.

However, I do want to learn from my mistakes! During the race, I felt great until mile ~7.5, when I felt my legs getting really heavy. I knew I was cooked right there and then because I had almost 19 more miles to go, so I slowed it way down. I felt fine endurance wise but I was physically gone after that point. Is this “the wall?” I’ve never heard of anyone depleting so quickly, so I’m not sure if this is actually something else? Despite my intentions, I know I went out way too fast, but still surprised how quickly my body gave up haha. 

I’d planned to fuel at 8,12,15,18,21 — same as training — but ended up having to take them earlier and more often given how bad I was feeling. In training, I ran up to 20 miles 3 times at “easy pace” (~10min/mile which is basically my race day average 😆) and felt fine after each (able to run a medium 6-10 mile run the next day). These included similar scaled elevation gains too. 

I definitely know I was undertrained, but not sure if I’m missing any other factors here! If not, I know what to do (more long runs, start slowwww, more fuel early on), but curious if that’s all there is to it, just because I’d never seen anyone else blow up early before! 

Thanks, and congrats to all other finishers this weekend :)))"

# Training (yes...it's a long section)

I've benefited so much from this community and am super excited to contribute with this Boston Marathon report.

Some background: I ran my very first marathon when I was in my first year of law school in 2011. Walked away with a time of 4:46:34. I knew nothing about training for a marathon, and previously had only run as a member of my high school cross country team because the XC team didn't have tryouts and I needed a sport to add to my college applications. I trained for that first marathon by doing progressively long runs while I was a teacher in Seoul.

Fast forward to 2022, I ran my first half marathon, and podiumed (small half in NYC). With that under my belt, I got curious about running the NYC Marathon. I saw that the NYC Marathon was part of this thing called the Marathon Majors, and saw that Boston was one of the other majors. One thing led to another and I signed up to run CIM in December 2023, and began doing the 9+1 that same year to get into NYC (now I'm committed to chasing all six/seven stars).

For CIM, I used a training plan that I got off of the NYRR running app. I think the plan was \*fine\* but I didn't have a fuel plan, because I did not think about fueling, so ended up hitting the wall very hard at CIM, and got a time of 3:49:35. That was fucking rough.

I was \*pissed\*, so a week later, I signed up for the 2024 Copenhagen marathon. I'm a female runner, age 36, so the qualifying time that I was shooting for was 3:35. I kept getting Track Club Babe's content strewn onto my feed, and decided to take a chance on her BQ training plan.

TLDR, the plan worked really well, and I qualified for Boston at Copenhagen with a time of 3:22:27. It felt good to go in with a 12 minute buffer. I used another one of Track Club Babe's plans to run the 2024 NYC Marathon and completed that in 3:25:02.

The NYC Marathon is when I lost faith in the Track Club Babe's training plans. I felt that they had been great for getting me to my baseline, but I was interested in going faster. I remember feeling as if I didn't have enough mileage going into the NYC Marathon, and definitely felt very much like I was dragging miles 24 thru 26.2.

So...I decided to turn to Pfitz. I was nervous about using a Pftiz plan, because I hadn't seen too many female runners talking about it, and didn't want to get caught up in the runfluencer bro hype and overtrain. That being said, I knew that the TCB plans did not have enough mileage for me, and Pftiz has been a standard for...a very long time. I was pretty sure I could handle the 18/70 plan on my base, so I decided to go for it. It really became a 16/70 plan, because I was going to go for 12/70 originally, but then I read some of his book and decided to go for the longer plan, especially since Ramadan would be all of March, and I wanted to have solid miles in before it started.

The first couple of weeks on Pftiz were definitely rough. My pace for my first MLR and subsequent long runs was \~8:45/mile. I used [this calculator ](https://chriseidhof.github.io/running-timing/)to figure out my workout paces, and knew that for a target 3:10:00 marathon, I needed to get my long runs between 7:59 to 8:42.

I was surprised that there were no track workouts in the plan. I didn't modify the plan too much, other than taking a couple of extra rest days when I began fasting during Ramadan to let my body adjust. I didn't fast on my days when I did LT workouts or my long runs. I coupled my runs with a Track Club Babe strength training plan, which meant that I was doing strength about 4x per week. All in all, I complied with about 90% of the plan over the 16 week time period.

My MLR/long run time dropped from 8:45, to consistently 7:45/7:50, which was wild, since that was my marathon pace in Copenhagen/NYC. Pfitz doesn't prescribe specific hill workouts, but thankfully I live in an area that has some pretty great hills, so as I got toward the middle of the plan, I made sure to end all of my runs uphill, or to incorporate aggressive hills in the middle of the workout (I did not want to be caught unprepared by the Newton Hills or Heartbreak).

Toward the end of the cycle, I was doing 10ks, pretty easily at 6:45/mile (felt cruisey, comfortable, and not like I was pushing the pace too hard). All in all I could \*feel\* a significant difference in preparedness in the week leading up to Boston vs the week leading up to NYC (I felt heavy, legs weren't turning as quickly, etc).

# Pre-race

I got into Boston on Saturday, and navigated the zoo at Hynes to get my bib. Snagged a jacket at the expo, and made my way out of there ASAP because the walls felt like they were closing in.

I was staying with a friend in Boston, and once I got to her place, I settled in, and went on a quick 4 mile shakeout around the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.

Earlier that day, I had some rice, sweet potatoes, hard boiled eggs, and kimchi for breakfast. We went out for pizza that night, and I had about half of a 12 inch pie for dinner.

On Sunday, I prioritized staying off of my feet. I met a friend for brunch at Cafe Bonjour (highly recommend), had eggs Benedict with smoked salmon, then went back to the apartment, and continued to eat throughout the day, finishing the pizza, and then having some rice with honey in the evening.

Before I went to sleep, I laid out all of my gear, including all of the gels that I would be taking.

On Marathon Monday, I got up at 5:00am (I was in Wave 3, so needed to make the bus loading by 8:15). Had some oatmeal with quinoa and flax seed added to it (about 250 calories), as well as an orange and tea. I headed over to the T to the train over to the Commons.

It was an absolute zoo. I dropped my gear bag, and then made my way over to the port a potty, because of course, I really needed to go \*just\* as we were supposed to get onto the bus. I'm really grateful that I did, because I was expecting a 30 minute ride to Hopkinton (I know, I know..but I'm a newbie), and it was an hour long. The bus left at about 8:50, and we got to Athlete's village at about 9:50. I had a Mauten 160 Solid right around then.

Once off the bus, we passed through Athlete's Village, and immediately started making our way out of Athlete's Village. I needed to use the bathroom badly \*again\*, but was worried about missing the start (I had like 3 dreams about missing the Boston Marathon in the week leading up to the event).

Luckily, there are bathrooms close to the start, and the lines were way better than the tangle of people you had to navigate through on the Commons. I used the bathroom, and then started shedding my throwaway layers. I also grabbed some glide off of a table, and used that to prevent thigh chafing (I run in Tracksmith shorts, which I love, but sometimes...there's a little rub). I got rid of my throw away jacket, and started stuffing my gels into my bra and into my shorts pocket.

I had a lot of gels. Here is my fueling plan (which I pretty much executed):

Start line: UCan - Pineapple

Mile 4: Maurten 100

Miile 8: Maurten 100

Mile 12: UCan - Pineapple

Mile 15: Maurten 100

Mile 18: Caffinated UCan (Vanilla Latte)

Mile 21: Maurten 100 (I skipped this one)

Mile 24: Maurten 100

I also carried a water bottle ([this one](https://www.fleetfeet.com/products/flipbelt-arc-waterbottle-11oz?sku=FBAWB1-GRN-11)) which had water mixed with Gatorade Zero (my preferred electrolyte is Liquid IV, but we'll get to that later).

Gels stuffed in pockets, nerves coming to the surface, I made my way to Corral 1 for Wave 3.

# Race

Once in the corral, I did some stretches, and halfway listened to the announcer chit chatting. I kept an eye on the clock, and as it counted down to 10:50, all I thought to myself was...I guess I can't call an Uber back so I'm gonna have to run there.

10.50am came, and we were off.

I have been obsessively reading about the course for the last three months. Once we started, I knew that it was going to be tight and crowded. I felt myself back, and let everyone else weave around me. Throughout the race, my mantra was...""Be patient"". I knew that I had to run a smart race because of the course layout.

The first mile went by in 7:29, which was 19 seconds off of where I wanted to be. The road opened up after that, and I settled into my target MP (7:09).

Things were pretty uneventful. I wanted to push the pace, but decided to let go of the A stretch goal (sub-3). I decided that Boston was not the course for that goal. I had trained for 3:10 (the London Championship time), so that was what I was going to prioritize. I felt strong and confident, and once I made the decision to let go of chasing sub-3, I was able to dial in and focus.

There were a couple of people that I ran with who were pretty steady at 7:05 to 7:10. I stuck with them so that I wasn't always looking down at my watch. Eventually, they fell behind me, and I was running solo.

I took my gels at 4, 8, and 12, and 15 without any issue. When we were approaching the sign for Mile 16, another runner came up with me and asked what time I was targeting. I said ""3:10"" and she was going for about the same. I knew what was coming up and said, ""Ready for some hills?""

The Newton Hills were less aggressive than I expected. I had been prepared to lose about 30 seconds per mile in the hills, but I came through mile 17 at 7:18, mile 18 at 7:17, mile 19 at 7:13, and mile 30 at 7:15. I didn't feel like I was charging the hills. I just kept going for controlled effort, breath out on step 4 and breath in at step 8. Nice and controlled.

Mile 18 was a little bit dramatic, because that was when I took my caffinated gel. Somehow some went down the wrong pipe, and I started hacking and coughing. Not cute. And then I was washing it down with orange flavored Gatorade. Which was gross, because the gel was Vanilla Latte flavored. Nasty AF. But it went down. Finally.

Heartbreak was a bitch. It wasn't as long as I expected. But it is steep. Which is RUDE at that point of the race. I reminded myself that my job was not to charge the hill, but to breath and keep effort steady up it. Mile 21 was the slowest mile of the race for me, which I expected, at 7:34.

When I. saw the sign at the top of Heartbreak, I reminded myself that the rest of the race is pretty much downhill. Despite my controlled effort, my legs did feel dead, and I wanted to end the race there. But I managed to pull back, with mile 22 at 7:10. I felt sick after eating the gels and the orange gatorade (I so wish I had my normal Liquid IV), and I felt a little cramp in my side.

But at that point, I reminded myself that I had less than 10K left.

The crowds in Boston are insane. I didn't take my gel as planned at mile 21, because eating another gel just felt gross. I let the crowd energy pull me along until the overpass, when I did take my final gel at mile 24. I saw the Citigo sign, and remembered that the last bit of a marathon is run, not with your legs, not with your brain, but your fucking heart.

I don't remember getting to that right on Hereford, and left on Boylston. But I do remember running toward that finish line with all of my might.

# Post-race

I hadn't built in enough buffer to account for the course difference between Strava and the official course, so Strava had my 26.2 at 3:09:40, but my official time for the course is 3:11:24. I'm slightly salty that I missed my Championship time by 1:24, but I'll run a half marathon this summer to lock down the time I need.

I still can't quite believe that I am a Boston Marathon finisher. And that I ran an 11 minute PR on the fucking Boston Marathon course. Personally, this has been an absolutely insane year, and running has been the thing that has grounded me. It was a perfect day, with magical crowds and a magical course. I'm so grateful that I had the opportunity to run my first Boston this year, and I know that I will absolutely be back. As a New Yorker, I had a bias toward the NYC Marathon, but I gotta say that Boston has NYC beat on Marathon Monday. This course and this town are something truly special.

I'm definitely still sore, and going to take a full week off. I'm going to be doing another round of Pfitz 18/70 starting June 8, as I chase that sub 3 in Chicago. I'm pretty confident that I can do it.

Thank you so much to all of the people that make this Advanced Running subreddit so helpful. You guys are the best.

### Training
Ever since I got back into running during COVID, I've used the service/app TrainAsOne for my training planner.  I basically uploaded a previous year of runs to it, told it my goal time and race day, and it lays out a plan to (hopefully) get you there.  I had previously run a 3:05 marathon, and I was diehard to finish sub-3.  I ran the Charlotte marathon in November and had a disappointing 3:18 finish after hitting the wall at around 17 miles.  In reflecting why, I realized that I wasn't taking nutrition seriously enough and I simply ran out of fuel during the race.  I was taking the same small number of gels during the race as I always had, but my pace was much faster so it simply wasn't enough.  I'm probably lucky I didn't get injured based on how I was treating my body.  

In any case, I educated myself on proper performance nutrition (I binged the 'Fuel for the Sole' podcast while running), and it made a HUGE difference in my speed.  I fueled with Maurten gels, bought a Flip Belt to hold them all on my long runs, started managing my carb and protein intake, got my sweat tested via Levelen to see how much water/sodium I should be consuming, started taking Momentous protein powder after runs for recovery, and adjusted my eating habits.  I gained a few pounds, but my runs got faster, easier, and I was less sore.  I crushed through the last of my training, and felt pretty well through peak week, and was theoretically well prepared for a sub-3 finish.  The 3 weeks before the taper each had about 60 miles in them, of various amount of speed work. My longest run was 20 miles.

Taper week was especially rough this time around.  I felt bad the whole week, and it really took a toll on my confidence.  I read in this subreddit that it's totally normal to feel this way, but man was it rough.  Every little tweak made me worried, and I felt lazy and restless.  TrainAsOne had me doing some sprint work during the taper, but I ignored it to prevent any injuries so close to the race.  I made sure I got tons of sleep.

3 days before race day I carb loaded.  I had 500g of carbs a day using ""safe"" foods that I knew my stomach could handle.  It was a bit of a chore eating that much, but it really helped.  

### Pre-race
The Wilmington marathon is point-to-point starting at 7am, so I got a VRBO right near the starting line.  I ate at bagel at 5am and a sports drink at 5:30 (Skratch).  I geared up and was at the race start at 6:40.  I took a 160 Maurten gel a few mins prior to the race, took a few pre-race photos, and began the race at 7.

### Race
The Wilmington marathon is flat and fast.  A cold front came in the day before, so it was a perfect 30 degrees at the start with the sun coming up.  Even though my training pace was sub-3, I wanted to ensure that I didn't flame out too early so I ran the first 11 miles or so with the 1:30 half marathon pacers.  At one point the course became narrow, so I took off in front of them and didn't see them again.  I started slowly tapping the gas as I went, and kept it pretty consistent until around 18 miles.  At that point I stopped listening to podcasts and switched to my running music, and ditched my water bottle.  That was a big confidence boost, since I now felt lighter without my bottle and the music got me pumped up.  I had diligently been taking Maurten gels every 30 mins, so I felt no inklings of hitting the wall, which was also a confident booster.  I started speeding up and began a long series of passing other runners.  I remember how absolutely dead I felt at the 18 mile mark just a few months ago, and it's crazy how much better I felt.  I had tons of energy still, and was even air drumming at a few points, much to the amusement of the runners that had already made the turnaround and were running back my way.  

I continued chasing down other runners for the last 6 miles, and had a really strong feeling that this was the race where I was finally going to break 3 hours.  I gave it all I had the last mile and finished with a very pleasing 2:56!  I never thought I'd be able to accomplish a time like that, but I did it.  It was a 10 minute PR!  Huzzah!  

### Post-race
Post race, I felt shockingly well.  I was exhausted to be sure, but nothing like previous races.  I was only mildly sore, and felt that I may have left some time on the race course.  Maybe I should have started sprinting sooner?  In any case, I felt surprisingly well and was in high spirits.  Lots of pics afterwards and congrats from my ever supportive wife and family.  Turns out I placed 3rd in my division and won some cash :)

Within 3 months, I went from a 3:18 to a 2:56 and felt fantastic.  I attribute the majority of that improvement to my focus on nutrition and properly fueling for my training and race day.  Other factors like weather, hilliness, and improved fitness played a role for sure, but I think the majority was due to my nutrition changes.

Thanks for reading.  Keep on running!

### Training
I’m a 36M who started running in mid-2023. I have no prior running experience or sports background. I was able to ramp up mileage very quickly and ran my first marathon in February 2024 in 2:59 off a Pfitz 18/70 program. I made a prior post titled “Couch to sub-3” if you are interested. Throughout the remainder of 2024 I kept my mileage up (ended up with 3,712 miles total for 2024). I signed up for the Houston Marathon because it is a) flat unlike the hilly Austin marathon and b) a short drive away.


I opted for the Pfitz 18/85 program this time around. However, I heavily modified it with Canova-style workouts. Essentially I used the mileage schedule of Pfitz but did every long run fast (for example, 85-95%MP, or sections of 100%MP). I did long runs on Sunday, and since this was such a substantial effort, I shifted my other workout days to Wednesday and Friday. I dropped many of the longer threshold workouts and substituted in many of the Canova Fartleks. I really enjoyed those workouts that integrated various distances of faster than MP (ranging 105-110%) with recoveries that were still fast (85-90%MP). I heavily utilized the resources that u/running_writings put together on his blog, linked below. Many of my workouts were directly lifted form the Emile Cairess plan, but scaled down to an appropriate amount for a non-elite (usually about 75-80% of the work distance).

https://runningwritings.com/2023/12/percentage-based-training.html#more-946


My training went really well until when I was supposed to peak in December and got two nasty illnesses (thanks, children) that saw me febrile for days on end on back-to-back weeks. This made me miss several key long runs and had weekly mileage down to about 35. My confidence got fairly shaken, as it took me the better part of 4 weeks in total between being sick and then recovering to get back to feeling okay. I had about 2 weeks prior to the taper that I fit in a few workouts, but I was left a bit unsure of my fitness.


### Pre-race
The Houston Marathon is fantastic, and I highly recommend it. Everything is so well-organized and easy. The best part is being able to hang out in the convention center, which is about a half mile from the start line, all the way up until you go to your corral. The weather for the race kept getting worse during the forecast leading up to the week. The start temperature was 32F/0C with winds directly out of the north at 15mph with 35mph gusts. I stayed inside as long as possible until I did my warmup en route to the corral then packed in. Thankfully, it was pretty warm with everybody bunched in together, so I never really felt cold. Just before the race I took a SiS beta fuel gel, and then we were off. Of note, there are a million indoor and outdoor bathrooms/port-a-potties and urinals. There is no need to wait in a line ever even up until the start with the last minute ones.


### Race
My race plan was to not worry about pace and just focus on effort. My goal was to run the first 10-11 miles comfortable and within myself. This part of the course heads west and south, so I knew I would have a tailwind. Mentally I had the next section as miles 11-18, which headed directly into the massive headwind. My plan here was to make sure I was attached to a group. I prepared myself for this to be the toughest section and to accept if my pace slowed down. Then the last section, 18 miles to the end, was going to be where I could speed up if I felt good.


I made it through the first section slowly picking up a little speed at the end to attach myself to a group that looked like they were keeping a pretty steady pace. Once we turned north I made sure I stayed in the pack. I was pretty shocked when, although I could feel there was a headwind, it didn’t feel that bad. On top of that, we weren’t even slowing down. Maybe it is because I had mentally prepped myself for this to be really tough, but it was a huge boost to get through miles 11-18 feeling…good?


When we got to about mile 18 and turned east back into town, my legs were still feeling great and I started to pick up the pace a bit. At this point, our pack started to split apart. The course meanders a bit, and people for some reason weren’t taking the tangents, so I found myself running a bit by myself. I took my last gel at mile 21.5 (I took five SiS beta fuel gels total every ~4.5 miles) for a total of 80gm of carbs/hr. There are a few “rolling” hills that weren’t anything near the end. The only reason they are noticeable is because of how remarkably flat the entire course is, it’s incredible.


With about 2 or 3 miles left, there was a rather unexpected and unwelcome section in which there was somehow a strong headwind. It was more obnoxious than anything, since I thought I had made it past that obstacle. However, the reward was the last half mile had a massive tailwind that literally pushed me towards the finish. Near the end, I could feel my calves getting tired, but really enjoyed the feeling of a strong finish.


My official time was 2:44:40. 


### Post-race
Once I finished I took a minute to get my legs back underneath me. Nothing hurt too badly. There is a ton of food to get at the convention center (sausages, eggs, pancakes, ice cream sandwiches, drinks, and tons more). It was nice to be served a full breakfast and be able to rest at one of the ample tables that are setup.


I ended up with a negative split of 1:23:11/1:21:39. I guess with that aggressive of a negative split maybe I left a bit of time on the table, but I’m super stoked with how I executed my race plan. Excited to get back to training. I think I’m going to stick with the Canova-style workouts and fast long runs, which I enjoy and seem to adapt to well. No races on the books at the moment, just looking forward to some unstructured training.

### Training
I did an 8-week training block for Boston, in which I set PBs in the 5k, 10k and half-marathon and was aiming for a marathon PB (sub-2:57). But as luck would have it, during race weekend, I caught a stomach bug and ended up having to run-walk my way to a 3:23 finish (it probably would have been closer to 4 hours if not for the amazing volunteers and crowd support that day) with a nasty sunburn to boot. 

After that disappointing result, I threw a pity party for myself but continued running ~70 MPW, though I didn't include any structured workouts, as I wasn't planning to run another marathon any time soon. 

A week before the OC Marathon, I had to be in LA for a family member's birthday and knew a few friends who were running it. Since I'd be doing a Sunday long run anyway, I figured I could use the OC Marathon as my Sunday long run. So I went ahead and registered three days before the marathon. No taper, no time goals and no expectations. I just wanted to enjoy a long run on a perfectly overcast morning.  

### Race
The OC Marathon starts at 5:30am, which was ideal for me as an early morning runner, as it made it feel like just another Sunday long run, though one with thousands of other runners around.

Even though I made it to the starting line area with plenty of time to eat a box of Mike and Ikes, use the porta potty twice and jog a half mile, I lost track of time and all sense of direction, not realizing I was on the opposite end of where the corrals were filling up. By the time I realized my oversight, the corrals were jam-packed, and the best I could do was squeeze in behind the 3:20 pacers. 

It took me about 4 miles to sift through the congestion. At the second aid station, the road finally started to clear up in front of me. From there, I was able to get into a nice rhythm, clipping off 6:30s and 6:40s. I couldn't believe how comfortable it felt. Two weeks earlier, I couldn't maintain my easy pace, and here I was running at PB pace and it felt like I was on cruise control.

A little over the 2-hour mark at mile 18, I ran into the 3-hour pacer, who seemed to be running quite a bit faster than 3-hour pace, and he confirmed as much when I asked him. It was only then that I realized that I was on track for a PB and just needed to maintain this effort for another 8 miles. And that's what I did, and I can't recall another marathon where it felt that comfortable to do.

### Post-race
After crossing the finish line and stopping my watch to see that I had run an almost 2-minute PB, I couldn't help but chuckle to myself. For Boston, I tried to do everything right, and things went pear-shaped in the finals days. For the OC Marathon, I was basically winging it -- no taper, no pace band, shoes I had never raced in, gels I had never tasted -- and somehow it worked out. 

I'm still reflecting on what lessons to draw. What initially came to mind was a David Roche video in which he said, ""Shooter's shoot."" We're probably all going to have bad races from time to time. I'm just glad I didn't dwell on my bad race for too long before getting back out there and having the best long run of my life this past weekend.

Race Plan

My race plan was designed to meet two goals: achieve what I trained for with the Hanson’s plan (6:25-6:35) while also avoiding the pitfalls of my 2019 NYC Marathon (PB 5k in first 3 miles over the Verrazano Bridge, lol). I don’t love starting with the crowd & pacer, but I also need  a way to fight the early race adrenaline.

Race Report (2:30 faster than C Goal, 2:30 slower than B Goal)

I finished the Houston Marathon  between my B&C goals. If I had seen my time before the race, I would have been slightly disappointed. But I finished the race with so much excitement, pride and happiness for pushing through what was a tough day. Long story short, 6:30 miles felt out of reach, and the NW headwinds on the middle third of the race were challenging. It was a really cold day. I ran just slightly negative splits (a first!) and puked all over the finish line.

I ran my third Houston marathon and saw a 10% year-over-year improvement from the 2024 HTX race and about a 4% improvement from June 2024 Duluth Grandma's Marathon. I don’t have a ton to report back. Miles 7-10 were particularly hard. I stuck with the 6:50 pacer who was running closer to 6:40-6:35s. I feel bad for those who were aiming for 3 and running way above pace with that pacer. 

I felt comfortable with a low HR at 6:50, 6:40ish was a good steady state, and anytime I pushed a 6:30ish mile I paid for  the next mile. Below you can find my plan vs. actual splits - you'll see my watch was \~4 seconds faster than my race - need to work on the edges...Biggest takeaway was that you really cannot race a marathon, tempting as it is. Next time I'll aim to train a little more by heart rate so I can push with confidence (or not).

Looking ahead, I don’t feel an urge to ‘break’ this personal best but I am itching to get running again. I’m taking a 3-4 week break (how hard a break is TBD).

**Training**

For the fifth time, I trained with the Hanson’s method, my fourth time on their [‘advanced](https://s3.us-central-1.wasabisys.com/hansons/Advanced_Marathon_-_new.pdf) plan’. I felt really comfortable with this plan, making modifications to it, and through this 20 week stretch, have come to understand how habit-oriented I am. Many marathon plans have variability across the weeks. Hanson’s is quite ordered, repeated week after week with only increasing mileage and intensity. I’ve come to know that Tuesdays are track, Thursday tempo, Sunday long. This pattern has given the rest of my life a lot of structure. 

You can find my plan [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17s3CpecBFv5ANiBHmnlpHm5IvSxDjWC0a9QitadNtds/edit?gid=1910795544#gid=1910795544), with tabs for previous marathons as well. I’ve tracked miles, aches, shoes and sentiments. I added two buffer weeks by starting early. I have historically gotten sick or injured over a 3.5 month training plan. However, this block I stayed healthy and ended with two extra weeks which equated to a total of five 10mile tempos instead of the prescribed three. This also gave me room to enjoy the holidays. I drank and ate some meat without too much self loathing.

I loved Scott Jurek’s book[ EAT & RUN](https://www.scottjurek.com/eat-run). Runners in his hometown Duluth seem to loathe him (cough Jeff) but his ideas on distance, friendship, competition, and nutrition motivated me me. Nonetheless, I ended up eating a good bit more meat than I would have liked in weeks 12-17. With the 60 mile weeks + introduction of weight lifting I found my body telling me it just needed more food. When I felt my meat consumption was getting out of hand, I watched the vegan athlete documentary [GAME CHANGERS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSpglxHTJVM) again which really fires me up :) 

Reflecting on this plan, I’ve come to love running so much. One of my greatest fears is that I’ll injure my knee, stop running, lose my mind. Running is my great escape, more so than writing: 6-7 hours a week without a phone. Sometimes I come home and barely remember leaving the house. The relationship between time, running and flow has been really beneficial to my mental health throughout the stressors of grad school, moves, work etc. 

On the whole, this training block went well. I set some PBs (5:13 mile, 39:00 10k). Pushed my easy paces a little harder. My only complaint about this plan is that it was hot and humid in Houston through November. People quip ‘summer miles bring winter smiles’ but some of those long November runs in 80 degrees with 90% humidity were just unpleasant.

Early in the plan I spent too many track days at 40-60 seconds under race pace instead of the 10-20 seconds under tempo that the plan recommends. Looking back, running slower would have been easier on my legs and probably resulted in better gains.

Lifting has been incredible for my mental and physical health. I lifted 2-3x week for 3 months - rotating muscle groups followed by a wicked core routine. It is quality time with friends with a focused goal. I've spent so much time this year running by myself - exercising with friends was a nice respite. Most of my lifting goals were around strengthening my core and my legs based on feedback I received from a running coach. This is supposed to help fitness and prevent overstriding, some of which can come from your legs overcompensating for a weak core.

**Mods to Hanson’s Advance Plan**

— Added 2x200 strides to the end of Monday & Saturday easy runs

— Added miles at tempo to the Sunday long runs (2-3 miles at race pace, just once early in the plan and then intervals later in the plan). Extra miles at race pace beyond the Thursday tempo gave me a lot of confidence.

— Added squats and leg work once a week

— Added core workouts 3x week + 3 minute planks (one front, one each side) every day

— Added three hip opening stretches (my max before I get bored!) to the end of most runs ([Myrtl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mj8uZ1Qtx3M) routine)

— Extended some easy + long runs by 2 miles while keeping workouts consistent w/ plan. Longest run was 17 miles.

— Largest training month ever (250 miles in December) + largest training year ever (2026 miles hehe). Running on constantly tired legs is insane, fatigue inducing, leaves me so hungry, but I rarely have trouble falling asleep (top 3 reason to run!).

**Pace-Markers that gave me confidence for ""A"" Goal**

— Wearing carbon-plate shoes for the first time (2-4% improvement from Duluth, AdiPro3)

— 5 months hard training (2-4% improvement)

— Lifting regimen (1-2%, especially on final miles, tysm Miles)

— Miles above race pace (3x10 mile at 6:25 during 60mile training weeks)

**Taper**

Hanson's plan calls for a 53 miles two weeks before the marathon and 26 miles Monday-Saturday before the race. I am toning those down about 10 miles each. I also squatted Friday (115x6 x 3) nine days before the race. Generally my body feels great, not too tired. During the race, I'll be watching out for pains in my lower back, right quad, right knee and right ankle that have historically flared in races. "

# Training

This was training all made up myself. I've had coaches in the past, but I feel like I understand what works well for me enough that I've been building my own plans for two years now. Began training for this the week of November 18, so I had a 14-week training plan plus taper week and race during the 15th week. Took awhile, but I was very happy with how this turned out. I got sick the second week of December and took 3-4 days off, but aside from that, I ran every day and progressed from 40 mpw up to 88 at my peak (plan was originally 85).

My intent with my training for this race was to heavily focus on getting really comfortable, physically and mentally, running long. I averaged 9-10 miles for easy runs and added a MLR in the middle of the week, which grew from 14 to 18 miles by the peak. Long runs started at 18 and progressed up to 25 miles. Looking back, I'm really proud of this training cycle, as I had to cancel my gym membership, so most of my easy runs and all the MLRs were in the cold and in the dark after work. Additionally, due to my work schedule, I ended up having to mostly do my workouts and long runs Mondays and Saturdays, which became a challenge as the runs became more intense. Another thing was trying to do almost all single runs. Nothing against doubles, but I wanted to get used to the longer runs and recovering from those, rather than breaking up the mileage. I started doing doubles on Fridays though, as a reprieve before the long run and so I wasn't finishing at like 7 or 8 p.m. on Friday night haha.

I have also been dealing with (I assume) a strained hamstring since the NYC marathon, so I barely touched anything faster than 5:45 pace and was even nervous to do strides, as I didn't want it to flare up. I've been wearing a quad sleeve every run, and it feels fine with the sleeve, but I gotta figure out how to get this better lol. Been working with my old athletic trainer too to do some treatment. Never had any issues with the hamstring delaying runs or anything, but it was a constant stress at the back of my mind.

Main focus in my workouts was, like the rest of the plan, becoming comfortable with race pace for longer periods. I did a lot of efforts at 6:10-20 per mile ranging from 2x3 mile to a 1-7-1 mile. Long run workouts were usually preceded by about 10 miles of warmup. I initially was doing time-based efforts, like 30' 6:15, 10' 6:00, 10' 6:30 to learn to continue running fast with fatigue on my legs. Idk if there is any science behind this, but I felt like it worked until I got to the point it was repetitive. Also did a 2x9 mile progression during a long run, and my pinnacle workout of the cycle (which I'll give credit to my friend for coming up with) was 2x30' 6:10 then 5x1 mile at 5:50 during the 25-mile long run. My last mile rep ended up being 5:33. This workout was three weeks out from the race and confirmed to me my fitness was in a great spot.

I didn't plan to do a tune-up race, but my partner was planning on racing an indoor 3k two weeks prior, so I decided to hop in. I had done zero speed work, so I didn't have a ton of expectations and was hoping for 9:40-45. Totally shocked myself and ran super even splits, raced really smart and ended up kicking a 32 final lap to win my heat in 9:29. While I wasn't sure how this would convert to marathon fitness, I was ecstatic about the race tactics and happy with the confidence boost this gave me.

# Pre-race

Week leading up, I always like to do 6x800m. I think these ended up being around 5:45-50 mile pace. Don't really put too much stock into them, but it's a workout I like to use as a tuneup. Did that Monday, then did 5-4-3-3 Tuesday-Friday. Strides were Wednesday, flew to Myrtle Beach Thursday and did some more strides Friday. Slept great throughout the week and was happy the restaurant pre-race had a yummy fettuccine alfredo with salmon.

# Race

I'll do my best here, honestly I was so locked in the whole time I kind of don't remember the entire race.  Took UCan Edge gels 10 minutes before then at mile 5-10-15-20. Had water at each water station (approx. every 1.5-2 miles maybe) except for the third one, where I dropped two cups and was super upset at myself.

First 3 miles I ran with my buddy I did the race with (in a banana costume no less!) They ended up falling back, and my first 5 miles I regressed actually as you can see in my splits. I was worried at this point if I had gone out too hard, as I had been planning on running hopefully around a 2:42 and went out at like 2:35-36 pace. Got passed by I think 3 other marathoners and a bunch of half marathoners.

Around the 10k point, a guy caught me and latched on and just rode my back for like 2 miles. I eventually basically forced him to run next to me instead so I wasn't just his wind shield. Ran with him for like 2-3 miles and then my buddy in the banana costume showed up out of nowhere and blew by us. Learned post-race, they said they had to got to the bathroom so put in a big surge to get to one quicker. The other guy ended up going with him, and they put about 30-45 seconds on me by mile 10. Mile 12 or so I saw my partner, which was a nice boost and allowed me to ditch my gloves, which were soaked at that point. At this point, I was in 6th place.

Miles 13-18 I was super in the zone. Not much to report. I passed the leader, now walking, around 15. I saw the guy who was ahead of me walk at the water station around mile 16 and knew I had a shot to go get him. Ended up catching him right around mile 18 and was able to put a gap on him. Miles 19 and 20 were definitely the toughest. I had moved into 4th, but 2nd and 3rd were probably like 60-90 seconds ahead of me and the wind was directly in my face, probably like 10-15 mph. At like 20.5 we made a turn, which I didn't even realize was part of the course, and I saw I was starting to close on 3rd place.

21-24 I was working really hard and managed to move up into 2nd place. I kept continuing to tell myself that I had worked so hard and didn't want to slow down just because my legs were starting to feel it (started feeling it at like mile 4 if I'm honest). Wind was rough mile 24 again, and then mile 25 included an annoying out-and-back, but by then I knew I was in a good spot and had the guts to finish. The out-and-back was sort of nice to see positioning, as I knew 1st was out of reach, but I saw two new guys about 45 seconds back and knew I had to keep grinding. Had no clue how much was left since my watch was a bit ahead of the mile markers, and there was no 26-mile marker, so kicked best I could. My partner's PR is 2:38:47, which I thought was out of reach, but turned the last corner to the finish and realized I was going to beat that, surged, and ended up at 2:38:41!

# Post-race

Really was not expecting to run this time at all. Goal was just to PR, and I was thinking with the training I had put in I was in 2:41-42 range, maybe 2:40 on a great day. Ended up having an amazing day beyond what I thought was even possible. Two days post and my hamstring feels about the same as it has, quads are getting there but still pretty tender. Still riding the high, and I'm excited to see what I can do moving forward. Have a half marathon in 3 weeks and another marathon in 5 weeks. Hoping for sub-75 for the half, no clue what my goal will be for the marathon though lol.

Been thinking a lot about the saying with marathons how ""the first 20 should feel pretty easy, the last 10k is when you have to work hard"" or whatever it is. I felt like I was working hard right from the start and the last 10k was excruciating hahaha. I've struggled a lot with pushing myself and the mental aspect of running, so while I'm amazed to have run this time, I'm even more impressed with my mental strength throughout the entire race to push through and trust in the training.

EDIT: I wore the adidas AdiZero Pro 4 for the race. They were hurting my toes a little by mile 22, but these have been awesome and fast. I do most of my training in Puma (Deviate, Velocity, MagMax)."

### Background
Male, late twenties, 170lbs. Have completed 2 marathons previously; first marathon was in Nov. 2023 was just to take part and did not complete any serious training, I finished in 4 hrs 5 mins. 2nd marathon took place in Spring 2024. I did a full 16 week block and achieved a chip time of 3:23.

### Training
I followed a 20-week block and used the Runna app. Having used it before, I found it convenient and it seemed to track well with other plans based on the mileage. I ran x5 per week, hitting ~85KM in the peak weeks. Weeks consisted of x2 Easy runs, x2 speed/track workouts and x1 long run. Easy runs started in the early weeks around 8KM and built up to 14KM in the peak weeks. Speed workouts were performed mainly at a local 400m track; 400m repeats, mile repeats, Tempo runs. Long runs alternated from easy pace runs to quicker/marathon pace efforts.

Training for the most part went well. There were a few times where life got in the way and had to hack together some runs in sub-optimal conditions, but I believe still showing up and getting it done is where some of the magic lies. No injuries to deal with. Kept up gym training (bodybuilding style training) most weeks that came in the format of x2 Upper and x2 Lower days per week. 

### Taper
I struggled a lot in the final 4 weeks of the block (2 weeks training and 2 weeks of taper). Sleep was poor, fed up with training and just not feeling buzzed at all. My previous marathon was far different, there was a steady increase in anticipation towards race day, but this time, I was so sick of it all. It seemed to start with one of my long runs 5 weeks from race day. The goal was 28K long run but barely managed to scrape past 23K. Multiple bathroom breaks (never happened before), sore legs, tiredness - from this run I never really seemed to get the spark back until race day.

My taper was fairly lacklustre. I only completed 2/4 runs in the first week of the taper and decided at this point I would prioritise recovery and rest - I figured I had most of the hard work done at this point.

My main goal for the race was to come in at least faster than my previous marathon (3:23), but was more aiming for sub-3:20. However, based on the last ~4 weeks of not feeling great, I wasn't really sure where I would end up. Having to travel for this marathon added a bit to the stress and anxiety around my performance. Are you seriously traveling for a marathon when you might not actually perform well? All this effort but to be in worse shape? These were some of the negative questions swimming around my head, but I pressed on.

I focused on lots of carbs, water and electrolytes from the Wednesday before the race.

My final training run was the Wednesday before the race. However, my lower back got very numb & tight. I had to stop multiple times to stretch it out. Was I cooked? This had never happened before. Did I not warm up correctly? Why does it have to happen now, so close to race day?

### Pre-race
Arrived in Vienna on Friday evening and head straight to the hotel. Ate a ""healthy"" McDonalds on Friday night, as there were no other food options open. I told myself to just get as much sleep as possible that night, as I knew from experience that the Saturday night sleep would likely be worse. Left the hotel at 1pm on Saturday, headed to the expo to pick up my race number. Then headed back to the hotel but stopped in a supermarket and picked up lots of fresh bread rolls (avoided the crap imported American bagels, I think this was a good move), water, bananas, caramel stroopwaffles, Tuc Crackers, greek yogurt, a protein bar and some chocolate croissants. Dropped the food back to the hotel and went for a very leisurely 3K shakeout around 4pm on Saturday. Straight back to the hotel, shower and began eating the groceries from earlier.

I had to check out the following morning as I was returning to my home city on Sunday evening so I packed my bags up and had everything ready to go on Saturday night. Lay the race outfit, gels & shoes on the floor and continued eating and chilled until about 11pm when I tried to sleep. Probably didn't end up falling asleep until 1am.

### Race Morning
Woke up at 6:30am and immediately ate a fresh bread roll, banana, stroopwaffle,  electrolytes and coffee. Went for a quick 10 minute stroll outside at 7am to help with the digestion. Came back to the hotel, proceeded to check out and locked my luggage in the hotel storage. Took my race bag, cracked a Redbull and walked to the subway station. The start line was a station 3 stops away so no crazy journey required, thankfully. However, we had to depart the train one stop short as the next station was full. This was a slight issue for me as the bag drop point was at the other station and my starting corral was at the opposite end - this meant walking down to the bag drop and walking all the way up past the other groups to my starting group. Queued for the bathroom from 8:40am and just about made it into the corral at about 8:58am. No real warm up was done.


### Race
Just after 9am, we set off across the Reichsbrücke Bridge. It was a cold morning, with temperatures around 0 celsius. I knew my target pace was between 4:25-4:30 per KM in order to achieve a 3:06-3:10 race so I stuck around that. My plan was to take a gel every 6K. The first 6K went well, as did the next 6K. No mysterious back pain at all, thankfully. By the time 18K came around, I needed a port-a-loo badly - nothing crazy but I just don't understand how some people don't need one for the full 42KM. Thankfully, one appeared at the 20K mark and made the pitstop. I garnered some new-found energy after this and made good progress up to 28K. I knew from experience that the real race starts from 30/32K onwards. The first 25K should have been fine, and it was. I entered the pain cave around 33K. However the great crowds and buzz really helped me push through. I kept telling myself to just get to 38K. From then onwards, you're so close. 38K came, the crowds got louder and I went for it. As you can see from my splits, I really pushed up the pace from this point. I was cautious to do this earlier, as I didn't want to jump the gun too early.

I knew from my paces that I was on track for a PR - my previous marathon was averaging 4:49min/km so I was well on track but I wasn't sure by how much. 

### Post-race
Beers and food


### Final Thoughts
Very happy with this new PR. After a very tough ~5 previous weeks, I was unsure of where my performance was at. It would have been crushing to have not gotten a PR or performed well, especially after the time commitment, the travel expense and some of the other opportunities I had said no to because of this marathon training.

Based on my report, what might you see as some key areas to improve come the next race? What might be something that you think I can target more?

### Things that Worked for Me
Run without music - I know the running highs are amazing with the tunes going, but there is something so empowering and therapeutic about being alone with your thoughts. AFAIK, some races don't allow headphones. And it's just one more thing to worry about on race morning - what if you lose the headphones/forget to charge them/drop that after the 1st KM? Prepare your mind & body to work hard without the help of music.

Showing up even when conditions/mind/body aren’t feeling it are immeasurably better than putting it off to tomorrow.

Training legs at the gym - specifically calf raises, leg curls & hamstring curls definitely made my legs bigger, stronger and more capable of dealing with the pavement pounding.


### My Questions
After completing two marathons with the Runna app, I feel I'm ready to graduate to Pfitzinger/Higdon/Jack Daniels. Based on my level, what might you think I should aim for?

I have no other marathons scheduled for now - I'd like a break! But I'm tempted by focusing on a shorted distance (5K or 10K) as something to aim for. However, I could see my next marathon being late 2025 or Spring 2026.

# Background

I went over this in my previous race report, but I ran a ton as a teenager, stopped when I got into cycling and got into running 2 years ago. I got injured a ton and never really got a good base before injuring myself again. The main issue was just me being overly ambitious and ramping it too much too quickly. Which ended up happening again. I was preparing for a Half Marathon in Naples Florida when during a routine Threshold workout, I strained my Hip Flexor and then on Thanksgiving day I tore it. The following week I came down with Covid. I went from running 41 miles a week to being barely able to walk forward with my left leg. I was told it would be about a 9 week recovery before I could return again but after a week of sitting on the couch I started to work hard to get back. 

I started to ride my bike, I did a lot of band workouts, and slowly started to run again. I honestly struggled a ton, lots of runs were awful, I was in pain, my mental health fell off a clif, and most runs I cried, wondering why I was even doing this. I would occasionally put together a good run or two, then have 7-9 awful runs. This was truly miserable I really questioned it all.

Early Feb was when I was fully able to train again. I only had 4 weeks to tune up for a 5k. I only completed 2 specific workouts during that time, a 10x800m at Threshold and a 16x200m. The 200s actually gave me a lot of confidence and I was really stoked about it, but I soon slipped back into awful runs and a bad headspace. The Monday before the race I considered dropping out but I only wanted to make the decision in the morning after getting some sleep and I woke feeling fine.  I had a couple of easy runs leading up to race day and felt fine, I started to build some excitement towards the date and was really just looking forward to being on the start line of a race again. 

# Race

I got to the front of the corral and waited until the gun went off. I just kept reminding myself to shoot out past people and then find a nice steady rhythm. I sprinted out of the gate and felt so fresh, I quickly settled into my race pace and had people that I used as my guide. I would look down every so often on my watch and could see that I was running solid splits and that my HR was starting to creep up there. I felt super measured, after about 6 mins I told myself that I just needed to hold on for another 6 mins and if I still felt this good, I could push in the final 6mins. 

12mins in, I looked down and saw I was still on target, my HR was hovering around 186-188 and I was starting to fatigue a bit in my form. I wasn't as smooth as I was 6mins ago. I knew that I just needed to hang on and keep fighting. The group I was behind had surged up and I just couldn't hold on, I was starting to falter and the mins felt like forever at this point. I rounded the final corner and knew that I just needed to kick, I needed to kick now. As much as I tried it wasn't coming out. I was able to surge to the line but with not much left in me. I crossed the line a bit cross eyed, my HR had peaked at 189. 

# Post Race

I crossed the line and was just full of happiness, the job was done. I had raced and it was all finally over, this chapter was finally closing and I was so glad. I asked the person In front of me what his time was and he told me it was 18 something. I checked my phone and the results were coming in live. I was able to see that I had done it. I found my partner, we got a photo together and I just felt this huge pressure on my shoulders slide off. I can't believe I got the job done, I went out there, raced with my heart and was able to PR and achieve both my other goals. 

The weeks leading up to this were all very dark times and I am glad I held on. There were so many runs where I cried and wished I wasn't hurt, so many times where I would get out of bed with no motivation, and so many times where I couldn't see the end to this journey. Next on the radar is potentially a 10k in May, time will tell though. 

A huge thanks to everyone who has posted their own race results in the past couple of months, I would read this every night before bed and be so proud of every single person.

### About Me
36M. I have been running for about 14 years now. Started easy, grew to love it, and built all the way up to a marathon over a couple years. That was back in 2013. Trained hard to the point where it started to become a chore, but as a novice, didn't quite know what to expect during the race. Hit the wall at mile 20, had a bad time, and swore off marathons. At that point, I transitioned to just running for fun. 

Fast forward to now, 12 years after my marathon, 12 years of running for fun. Have 2 young kids. Beginning to feel my age, and I suddenly get to urge to beat my half marathon PR from the lead-up to that marathon (1:29:50). Call it a midlife crisis, but between kids and work, I needed something to do for myself, and this goal seemed like the least destructive. So I signed up for this race and decided I'd give beating that 12-year-old PR a go. 

### Training
In NC, summers can be long and brutal. I started training around Thanksgiving with a goal of building up to approximately 50 miles from my base of 30. Was able to hit the mid-40s by December, and, being wary of my age, I increased very slowly from there (1 mile per week). I didn't follow any specific plan but tried to stick to running every day. Since kid #1 was born, I switched to more frequent (read:daily) shorter runs in the early AM to avoid shirkong childcare duties. 

I previously just kind of ran by feel, which landed me in the too easy to benefit, too hard to recover zone for almost all my runs. This sub has been very insightful in helping me come to that realization and put together a reasonable training plan. So a thanks to all you folks for your helpful tips. I did buy a HR strap with the goal of using HR zones as a guideline to keep myself from getting too excited on the easy runs, and it was good for keeping me in check. 

I decided to stick with 2 workouts + a long run every week with the rest being easy. After reading about the Norwegian Singles method, my two workouts became sub-threshold runs with usually 4 x 6-minute intervals at somewhere around the mid-6s, aiming for low zone 4 HRs. As the long run distance crept up, I began to include 2-3x 14 minutes of sub-threshold work into the long runs for some quality and to vary up the longer miles. My paces drifted downward at the same HR values, and I began to really notice the results from dedicated, disciplined training, which I realized I had never done for a race prior to this one. 

My peak run was 15 miles with 3x 14 minutes sub-threshold. Probably a little much, but nailing this one gave me tons of confidence. I figured I should have a 1:27 in me and could possibly go into the low 1:20s on a good day... 

### Pre-race
But a good day was not in store. On Sunday morning, it was high 60s with near-90% humidity and potential storms on the way. Was honestly expecting them to cancel, but they did not. I did find a race day pace calculator to help plan for these types of conditions, and it informed me that I should plan to take around 13 seconds/mile off my pace, or somewhere around 3 minutes off my goal. Not ideal, but I trained hard and still felt good about taking down the PR at least. 

### Race
The race starts at first light at 7 am. My plan was to ease into my pace, and the crowded start helped with that. The first mile was all about finding my position. I was tempted to go with the 1:30 pacer when I reeled them in but felt I had just a little better in me, so I pushed ahead. We continued for 2.5 miles on roads until we hit the American Tobacco Trail, where the main portion of the race would be run. 

They advertise this course as fast and flat, which isn't entirely true. It's not a super challenging course by any means, but there are several rolling hills and gentle inclines. Miles 3-5 were a gradual downhill, which meant on this out-and-back course that miles 8-10 would be a gradual climb. As I hit the turnaround near 43 minutes, I saw my HR hitting the 170s, which is usually my sign to back off as I tend to not be able to sustain this level for more than a few miles. 

However, with the climb from miles 8-10 still ahead of me, I pushed forward instead. Around mile 10, I noticed plenty of runners starting to drop off. Historically, I tended to positively split my races, especially that marathon. So I definitely understood their pain, especially on this miserably humid morning running uphill toward the end. 

The climb is over and we turn off the trail, into the final 2.5 mile stretch. It takes all my focus and willpower to not drop my pace. Around mile 12.5, we make the final turn toward the finish line. One of the staff (course organizer, I would bet) was shouting that ""It's all downhill now! You can do it!"" For some reason, this pumped me up, and I hit that hill as hard as I could. I was able to manage a bit of sprint into the finish, saw 1:25:something as I crossed, and wanted to fall over dead. Conditions were far from ideal, but I somehow managed about as well as I could've hoped for on a day like this. 

### Post-race
Felt exhausted and beat as I grabbed all the water I could. Legs were on fire, but this gradually improved over the course of the day. Now, I feel fine. Thrilled with my time. If that calculator is to be believed, I probably have 1:22 or so in me on ideal conditions, which makes me rethink swearing off marathons. Maybe with dedicated training, I could go sub-3 or even push for a BQ. Tempting prospects...

Hey folks, this thread has been super useful for me over the last few years. Now it is my turn to share my experience with a race I hope to qualify as advanced. Enjoy and take care!

**Motivation**

Running a 6-hour looped race was on my list probably since my first sub 3:00:00 (report at this thread [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdvancedRunning/comments/dnroid/sub_3_marathon_thank_you_all_for_your_support/)) marathon back in 2019. It was a significant milestone as it was my first race for which I prepared with a trainer. Not long after the watch stopped at 2:56:48, I started to wonder what times or distances I could chase. But I don't mean just checking off boxes.

Over the last couple of years, I've logged thousands of kilometres and improved my PBs on shorter distances or tried 20 to 50 km trail runs, finishing usually among the top 3-5%. Currently, I wish to get sub 80 minutes in halfM and 2:50 in a marathon. My guess is the shape is there, but some failed attempts signal that during race day everything just has to click, especially the fueling. This is why I signed up for a 6-hour looped race - it requires a specific approach, not just haphazardly taking random gels, I know nothing about.

**Preparation**

I'm putting in the bank 70-75 km weekly on average, following the classic pattern with large winter volumes where I'm significantly above my average, that smoothly blends into some quality training where I usually mix hard and chill weeks. Despite this experience, I was still surprised by how different the 4 weeks before the race looked.

The two-phased training terrified me initially, as I really don't like morning runs. I was now given the opportunity to jump out of bed for a chilled 15-20 km run or 10 km tempo run (4:20 min/km) followed by additional tempo runs in the afternoon/evening. Previously, I'd only done 5 km morning shakeout, and every time I felt like I would throw up after skipping breakfast. This time, I had a drink and a banana before lacing up my shoes, and to my surprise, it worked well. I even enjoyed it, though I still prefer running in the afternoon.

To sum it up, the four weeks prior to the race could be characterized by increased distance with significant effort (z3), keeping my body and mind tired to get used to it. As a special treat, I had one day with 6x 5 km runs every two hours, which was mental, plus some uphill intervals with lots of repeats (probably to train the head). Was it hard? Hell yeah! Was it worth it? You bet!

**Race Day**

The race day arrived with perfect weather - cloudy with temperatures around 14 °C, and a course that was 1.176 km per loop.

My strategy was to start somewhere between 4:35-4:40 min/km pace and maintain it as long as possible.

Race goals:

* A goal: 75 km 🔴
* B goal: 70 km 🟢 (official results: 72.03 km, 4:58 min/km pace; 3rd overall/2nd male)
* C goal: 60 km 🟢

Regarding fueling, I asked an experienced colleague (shout out to them) who recommended Maurten gels, as they're gentle on the stomach, plus electrolytes. My strategy was to take one gel every 40-45 minutes and electrolytes every 12 km. I also packed some sweet and salty treats in my personal bag to avoid wasting time at the official refreshment station. This strategy worked perfectly - I only had minor stomach issues once, which disappeared after I started sipping Coca-Cola occasionally. It was the only treat I needed, as the gels worked just fine. Huge lessons learned!

I should also mention my pre-race nutrition: 6 Crêpes Suzette for breakfast (shout out to my fiancé) and a large pho-bo for lunch! Definitely a solid base that helped me get through the day.

I calculated that at a 4:35 min/km pace, each loop should take about 5:25. I expected my watch would struggle under the tree cover in the park, and I was right - my Fenix 3 was lagging behind, so I focused only on elapsed time (by the end, the difference was around 6 km during the 6 hours).

Shortly after the start, it was clear that first place was reserved for a well-trained Spaniard who was in a totally different league. I ran my own race, checking my progress each lap while maintaining 2nd/3rd position. I barely remember the first two hours as I was completely locked in. After passing the 1/3 milestone, I realised everything was going well - perhaps too well, as I might have been running slightly too fast. Surprisingly, I wasn't concerned about the time remaining or the repetitive loop course, which turned out to be the least of my worries.

The problems started after the marathon distance (around 3:10). The period between the 3rd and 4th hour was the worst, with my pace slowing and my stomach becoming unsettled. I fought to stay focused, setting a goal that once I hit the 4-hour mark, I would reward myself with a sip of Coca-Cola. I hoped it would help my stomach, but I worried I might throw up. Luckily, the Coca-Cola helped, and it shortly became my ritual to take a sip after every 5 loops (now I wish I had started this earlier).

The last 2 hours were challenging as everything hurt. However, I gradually returned to my rhythm, managing to run faster than during the 4th hour. Once the clock showed less than two hours remaining, I locked in again on my goal, realizing that my B goal of 70 km was still possible. At this point, I had totally lost track of my position (though it was displayed on the monitor, lol). I reached 70 km with almost 13 minutes of race time left. Although my plan was to take it easy after 70 km, I kept the tempo, finishing with 72.03 km – enough for 3rd position overall and 2nd male. This became my longest run ever (my previous longest was 50 km). Not great, not terrible for the first time attempt.

**Aftermath**

I felt instant relief when the gong signalled the end of the race. Finally, there was nothing to focus on. Mission completed. Was my body hurting? Yes, but it was nothing unbearable and comparable to how I feel after marathon races. What surprised me most was how mentally challenging it was to stay focused for six hours, even though I never run with headphones and consider myself good at focusing solely on running. The mental relief at the finish was incredible.

What's next? Definitely more running. As mentioned earlier, my goal for this race was to develop a fueling strategy. Now, knowing what works, I can focus on making a marathon PB this fall.

Am I thinking about another 6-hour looped race? Yes, but not this season. A huge factor in my success was the quality training I put in beforehand. However, I still remember that this training was not only harder than usual but also more time-demanding. Life is not only about running, although it has a super positive impact on getting through it."

### About Me

27, Male, 60-65 MPW

### Training
My pervious PR of 2:57 was achieved at the Columbus Marathon back in 2023. My training only peaked at 55 miles per week, and was based loosely around the Pfitz 18/55 plan, minus the mid-week long runs.

For some background, I've been running casually since highschool and Glass City was my 5th serious attempt at a marathon. My progression has been: 3:00, 3:00, 2:57, 2:59, 2:51. 4 marathons in a row within 3 minutes of each other certainly isn't what I would call a progression, however, it was a symptom of doing the same thing and expecting different results.

If you've read race reports on here before, you're probably already thinking ""this guy increased his mileage"". And you would be right.

For this block, I dovetailed my training with a half marathon training block from the fall where I ran a 1:21. My training included 55+ miles for 12 weeks with plenty of speed work sprinkled throughout. I took it easy for the last two weeks of December before cranking it back up to 60 miles a week, with 3 65 mile peak weeks in March. I also did 4 20 milers with speed work incorporated. Honestly, I've never felt fast than I do right now (minus the post-race fatigue, of course.) my HR at 7:15 pace has been around 136ish, which told me that I was ready to go faster than my previous 4 races.

For this race, I decided to use the ""manual lap"" mode on my watch and switch the ""total distance"" tracker to ""lap distance"". I did this so I would be racing the mile I'm in, and so I would be more cognizant of how well I was racing the tangents.

I also made a Spotify playlist with song suggestions from friends and family that had a duration of 2:55. I figured I would know about how much more I had left based on the song.

Originally, I signed up for Glass City. My wife and I booked a trip to Hawaii that was going to be leaving on Monday, so running on Sunday would work out great.

### The Issue

Due to scheduling conflicts and a flight change, we were now looking at departing from Detroit at about 1pm on Sunday. My wife and I were both concerned with how close we would be cutting it, so I decided to sign up for Carmel to prevent having to sprint to the Airport.

### Carmel
lol. Lmao, even. Drove 3 hours from Columbus, Got a hotel room, family came down to watch, and at 5:50 on race morning I get an email that says ""CANCELLED: Carmel Marathon"". 

Despite my frustration, I understood why they did it. The Carmel race director and team did a fantastic job following up about the cancellation and their rationale. They sent pictures of the finish line structure that was damaged beyond repair from the storm, and all of the gates scattered around the road. 

I drove home full of energy, and ripped out a 13 mile run at 6:50/mile. During that run, I made the decision to run Glass City, and devise a plan to get to the airport on time.

The schedule was as follows:

4:30am - Wake up
5:30am - Get to start line
6:30am - Start race
9:25am - finish racing and get snacks

Leave for airport by 10:30 after a shower and a meal.

Get to airport by 11:30

Board airplane at 12:20

### Race
Race day was perfect. I could not have asked for better weather, and the city of Toledo did a great job organizing the event. Met a few people who were also going to run Carmel as well.

Miles 1-4: 
Simple loop around the block. Several churches had clergy members flinging holy water at us, which was funny. I was hitting my splits, and felt relaxed heading up to university hills.

Mile 5-12:
First chunk of the race was through Ottawa hills, which has some big houses, and plenty of crowd support. There was a water/gatorade stop around every corner here.

Mile 13-20:
Wildwood metropark and the first stint down the bike trail were simple with minimal turns. Was it scenic? Not really, but was it fast? You bet. It felt like I was on a Sunday long run in the best way. 

Mile 20-Finish:
6 miles of straight bike trail. If I had bonked, this would have been hell on earth. But I trained well and had a maurten 100 every 4 miles, so it almost felt like I was on a treadmill.

### Post-race
Finished in 2:51, power walked straight to the car to see my family, got home, 5 minute shower, inhaled a massive sub and coffee, and got the airport with a few minutes to spare.

11 hours of flying after a race isn't as bad as I thought it would be. Sure, I was sore. But I had an aisle seat, and had plenty of of food.

All-in-all, I recommend the Glass City Marathon. Happy with this race and training block.

### Training  
I am a Boston local and this was my 4th Boston marathon. Despite my love of my hometown race and the fact that I have done this MULTIPLE TIMES, Boston has always spit me up and chewed me out. Last year I ran a 3:26 in near optimal conditions while hoping for a 3:18, but had an awesome fall cycle with a 3:16:xx at the Wineglass Marathon in October. A more reasonable person might have aimed for just an enjoyable Boston this time, but I don't learn and decided I wanted to aim, yet again, for a PR at Boston, a course I have ALWAYS bonked on.  

I ran Pfitz 70/12 minus one early week where I posterior tibial tendinitis acted up and I cross-trained instead. I had a lot of dread this would be a factor in my build but it ended up fine? My PTT basically always hurt a bit, but never got worse, and ended up not being an issue at all in the race. Tendons are weird! Key workouts were an 18/14MP (decided I liked this better from the 70/18 than the prescribed 18/12) with 7:22 as MP and 12/7@HMP with 7:02 as HMP. Because of work and toddler parenting I didn't have a chance to do a proper tune-up race and as a TT I totally failed to run a sub-20 5K at my local Park Run which resulted in my yakking in the bushes with 0.1 mi to go (but I achieved my time if you subtract vomiting time! That counts, right? The 5k is not my distance). All of this to say, I had some good benchmarks that I'd be on track, but had also always done terribly at Boston specifically and had no tune-up races to go off of ...  

### Pre-race  
I watched the weather with misery and dread all week while the usual taper crazies took their hold. Even the morning of the race I was still planning on trying for a PR; it wasn't until I was standing sweating in the corral that I realized how stupid that was and decided to down-revise. Woke up, hung out with my kid and ate a piece of peanut butter toast and a sugary coffee and took the T to the buses, then a plain bagel 1 hour before the race. Some people go inward when they are nervous; I make friends! Chat with other runners on the T and the bus. I was part of the Hopkinton Bus Fiasco and got let off somewhere between the Athlete's Village and the start line which was momentarily stressful but ended up okay even for the red bibs on my bus. Got to practice mental fortitude by trying not to pee my pants in line for the portapotty, then to the start.  

Corrals are in the unforgiving sun and I am ALREADY sweating. I chuck the sub-3:15 goal and decide to start out conservative, near my prior PR pace with an acceptance that I may have to reassess. Head to the starting mat, beg myself not to hit the downhills too fast, and here we go!  

### Race  
1-9: Feeling good, try not to weave or pass too many people, enjoy what I can, not stress too much about time except going too fast. Overall feeling good minus how hot it was but also tell myself I can't control that except to fuel and hydrate well. Take a gatorade for my mouth and a water for my head at every water stop. My husband and daughter are waiting for me at 8.6 in Natick, give them each a kiss, enjoy the aws from the crowd, and cry a little bit. That kept me floating (and a little too fast) for about a mile. First Maurtens at 40 min.  

9-16: In the zone. Keep it coming. My stomach is feeling a bit sloshy from so much liquid and sugar but work to keep it up and take the second gel. Cry, as always, in the amazing Wellesley scream tunnel. See my split at the half and realize I'm probably not in PR territory, but ready to see what the hills will do to me this year. Take the turn at the firehouse with a feeling of ""good! We're finally here. The wait is over.""  

16-21: My mantra is ""up by effort, down by feel"" I do not need to look at my watch, just keep moving up with a steady effort. I can already tell this is going better than all the other years just based on feel. It is hot as hell though, and lots of people are walking. What has always gotten me, though, are the downhills. I have never been able to recover my speed with shredded quads. What will this be like? Realize I am running the downhills! I am at pace! I am doing this! Somewhere in here I realize that under no circumstances can I take more nutrition in and while I know that may contribute to a bonk later, the prospect is too gross to try. Continue to take gatorade at each aid station though.  

21-24: I did not know this until this year but the downhill after Heartbreak is called Cemetery Hill, and it has been where I have bonked \*every other time\*. It's not like I'm flying, exactly, and my legs definitely hurt, but I am moving. I am in control. Down to Chestnut Hill Reservoir and spend all my energy avoiding the green line tracks. Here we are on Beacon, the best I've ever felt. But ugh, this felt so long. Amazing crowd support but I barely notice, can I start counting down yet? With some mental math I realize that even if I put up 8 minute miles I will beat my course record, and that keeps me going. And when I check my watch each time, I'm running faster than 8.  

24-26.2 Ow ow ow ow I really want to stop. My horrible brain keeps seducing me to maybe walk a bit, or stop caring about my time because it's so hot and my right heel hurts a lot and so does everything else. I've walked at Boston before, who cares if I do it again? I start counting down. Less than 15 minutes left. That's nothing! I can do this. Shit is the mile 25 marker farther than I think from the finish line. Manage to run up the underpass (I think a first for me?) and here we are: right on Hereford and I am \*passing\* other people, left on Boylston for a straightaway that is so much longer than it looks but I am still running and there it is, there's the finish!
  
### Post-race  
Turns out my heel, not my posterior tibial tendon, would be the issue as soon as I stop running. I make the long, painful walk down the shoot, then limp back to Park Street and make friends with fellow runners from all over the world on the T ride home. Take an extremely brief and interrupted shower while my toddler slams on the shower door in her eagerness to see me and then collapse on the couch while my gem of a husband takes her to the playground.  

I didn't even know or care what my actual time was until hours later and then it was better than I thought. A week ago I would have been so disappointed not to PR, but I don't feel that way now by a long shot. My second-fastest marathon and a course PR. 
 
###What's next  
I did not bonk in Boston! I still slowed, a lot, but there was no walking and no feeling like I absolutely couldn't go faster. I was passing people for the last 5 miles, including on Boylston itself! Amazingly my first half splits were near-identical this year and last year, but I ran the second half 6 minutes faster in far, far worse heat. I am so proud of this reflection of how much fitter I am than I was a year ago. While coming in 6000 ahead of my bib number is mostly a reflection of the blowup-worthy conditions, I'm still pleased with how I ran this race! 
 
A major takeaway though was that I still felt like garbage during the last 4 miles. I HURT. I WANTED TO WALK. I WANTED TO STOP. I felt more present and able to soak in the atmosphere than during prior years, but it certainly didn't feel fun. Someone on another post said ""it doesn't get easier, you just get faster."" And boy is that true! But another thing I need to work on is mental toughness, and how to negotiate with or shut up that lazy voice inside me telling me it's okay if I go slower, I don't actually want this badly enough. It is an aspect of training I have neglected.  

Here's where I need the r/AdvancedRunning brain trust. I am running Chicago this fall and am very excited at the prospect of a pancake flat course and a summer of heat acclimation. Using some temperature-adjustment calculators, my performance on Boston in the heat is *sort of* equivalent to my goal time for this cycle of 3:14:45, and for that reason I'm wondering if I should shoot even more aggressively for the next cycle (but not too aggressively ... like 3:13, maybe?). At my age I figure I have 5ish years to keep getting faster; I don't know if I'll ever be a sub-3 marathoner but I'd like to at least see what I'm capable of within the limits of being a normal person with a job and a kid.  

To that end: should I buckle and buy super shoes? I run everything in Pegs which makes me feel very basic but also they are practical. I am a heel striker.  
I've loved reading every other race report; lots of love to the runners on here who somehow magically PR on this terrible course that always foils me and even more love to those of you who went out hot and had what I consider the ""true"" Boston Marathon experience of blowing up. <3

### Training
I'm currently approaching the end of a marathon training cycle. My current marathon PB from earlier this year is 3:09 and my previous HM PB was 1:22:59. With four weeks to go until my next sub3 attempt I really wanted to do an all out half to see where my shape is currently sitting. 

For the past 8 months I have been running between 60-80km per week, with most weeks sitting at about 70km, and a couple of odd ones up at 90km. I try to do a rough 80/20 mix of easy km's and speed work. 

I went into this race with a dream goal of Sub80, and the conditions were looking very promising. Overcast and around 16 degrees C. 

### Pre-race
Got up at 6am for a 9am start. Had my usual breakfast which is simple, oats with some milk and raisins. Also had two cups of coffee, some water and a banana.  The race was less than half an hour from my house, but I needed to park up and collect my bib so decided to leave some time. 

On my way out the door I mixed a bottle of water with Maurten 160 Drink Mix to sip on up until the bag drop about 40 minutes before race start. 

After dropping my bag, I queued for the toilet, then with 30 minutes to start ran about 1km easy to warm up and did some dynamic stretching and some shorter sprints to get my legs going. During this warm up I also had a Maurten Caf 100 gel. 

### Race
The race started just after 9am. It was crowded and took a few hundred meters to get any kind of space, despite managing to find a spot only 30 meters behind the starting line. 

I had decided to go out pretty hard, and aim for around 3:50/km splits to begin with. Then I would give it a few kilometers before re-evaluating, and make a decision on whether I thought a Sub80 would be doable. After a 19 minute 5k I was still pretty comfortable and decided it was worth an attempt. 

Now it was just a matter of cruising, clocking steady splits for a while. The course was relatively flat, but a few hills here and there meant easing off a little going up, then catching up again going down. Aiming for even splits without working too hard on the hills. 

This was also my first race in the Adizero Prime X2 and boy those shoes are comfy and fast at the same time. 

First Maurten 160 gel at 30 minutes - was going to take it at 7km but forgot.

Passing 10k at just about 38 minutes things were beginning to get harder, but my breathing and heart rate was still under control, I was in good spirits and surrounded by (some much heavier breathing) runners which kept me motivated hah. My goal now was to hold the pace until the top of the hill at 16km, after which I would have 5km of steady downhill all the way to the finish line. At 16km I was pretty certain I would make Sub80 as I had put the worst behind me, and could further push the pace up cruising down the hills. 

At 19km my right shoe lace came loose! I had felt it loosening slightly for the past 7-8 minutes, but now it was loose... Not sure how that happened, but I decided to risk it and NOT stop as I was in a good rhythm and the finish line was ""just"" around the corner. Luckily it worked out and didn't slow me down much at all. Stopping to tie my shoelace could have cost me the Sub80!! 

### Post-race
Final time was 1:19:16 which I was extremely happy with. The final three km's I was pretty much at max effort so I felt my race was well paced, with little left on the table. 

Now on to the main challenge in four weeks. Can I make Sub3 for the first time?

## Training

35 | M, Followed a modified Pfitz 12/55 after running Chicago last October in 3:04. This was marathon #6

After taking October/November off post Chicago, I very slowly started running again in December after finding a great group of runners near me who were prepping for Boston. My goal has always been to eventually sub 3 and this group of people really motivated and inspired me throughout this cycle; I jumped into the 12/55 plan in mid January and was able to run ~105% of the prescribed miles, increasing a few of the weeks with additional mid week miles. 

I made three changes to the Pfitz plan after running several 18/55 marathons previously. The biggest change was running only one TT, a local 10k that I ran in February with a 40:09. This was ~1 minute slower than the previous year which didn’t feel great, but at least I knew where I was in the cycle. 

I was more flexible around the types of track workouts I did because I was training with people doing different plans for Boston, so I might have replaced a 5x1k with 6x1mi, or hill repeats instead of a tempo run.  I also ran these faster than I historically would have which was difficult but not a killer. 

Finally, I ran more miles at MP during long runs, although I modified what they looked like. I didn’t do the usual 18 with 14 at MP, 16/12, etc. instead I replaced with more 3x3 or 3x4 MP intervals and generally tried to end most LRs with 2-3 miles at MP. 

## Race

Said goodbye to my wife and 4/2 year old kids Friday morning and flew to Indy. 

The weather couldn’t have been better at the start, mid 40s, and there were a TON of runners queuing with the 3:00 pacer. Off we went, and it was packed. The streets were very narrow with too many traffic circles to count and it was extremely congested for nearly the entire first half. Within the first mile someone tripped and fell, causing a pileup that ended at least a few people’s day. 

The miles clicked by, and I was happy to cruise around 6:45-6:50 for the first 10 miles. The course moved from the streets to a paved trail (the Monon) which would be great for a solo long run but was not conducive to a pack of ~50 people running at 3:00 pace. With walkers on the trail and crazy aid stations, it felt like a major marathon at times. 

As we began closing out the first half we substantially slowed in mile 12 which created a logjam; unbeknownst to me the pacer was crashing or injured and people were afraid to pass him. He bailed at the half (1:29:46) and without him, everyone panicked during mile 14 and sped up and the group thinned out which was awesome. 

Side note: the people around me were PISSED that the pacer bailed; I’ve never experienced that before but was content to run my own race but I do think fewer people hit their goal time because he jumped ship. 

I was feeling great, really enjoying the flat course, happy with where my body was and the timing through 14. I continued to take Maurten gels every half hour until 2:00, and then couldn’t really stomach anything else (a common problem for me). I ended up taking 1 pre-race and 4 during, supplementing with my drink mix and aid station water where I could get it. 

The marathon battle started around 21, and I began the mental gymnastics of calculating pace and time until we finished. My brother in law ran the half and found me at miles 23 and 24. I told him at the start that this was going to be my Icarus run, and he was screaming ICARITO! at me like a lunatic. It was the push I needed. 

I gutted through the last two miles, gave it everything I had, and crossed at 2:58:19, a huge PR, a negative split (1:29:46, 1:28:33), Sub 3, and hopefully (?) enough buffer for Boston 2025.  

## Post-race

Euphoria. This race was the culmination of many years of training and incredible support from family and friends. Something that once seemed impossible is now checked off the list. 

I plan to take some time off, prep for a TBD fall marathon, and cross my fingers for some Boston qualifying luck. 

Thanks for reading!

### Training
Coming into this training block I knew I wanted redemption after a horrendous Boston earlier this year, but things started extremely rough. Coming back from vacation, I got sick which took me out for nearly a month before I could start my easy base build again. But overall looking back at the entire block, the training went really well and I was healthy through the whole block. My training formula was quite simple and it consisted of steady Z2 runs, a track speed session, a tempo run, and the long aerobic run on the weekend. Weekly mileage was built steadily, but capped out at 47 miles which I know is much lower compared to other marathon builds targeting a sub 2:45. However, combined with cross training with swimming and biking, it also helped build the aerobic base. I also only did one marathon long run workout of 6 miles wu, 6 miles mp, 3x(1 mile float/1mile mp+10s faster), 4 mile cd. 

For reference, some of the workouts that I hit were 8x1km track with 90s jog rest (200m) at 5:20/mile pace and 10 mile tempo runs anywhere from 5:50-6:00/mile pace.

### Pre-race
Pre-race was really uneventful, which was a good thing. Picked up my race bib the day before and had a good last few carb heavy meals before the race. Went to bed around 7 PM knowing it would be an early morning. Race morning, woke up at 3 A.M to eat and get ready to take the shuttle to the start line. For some reason, my bus was freezing probably due to an open ceiling vent and I was just shivering on the bus since my outer layer was not accounting for this. But just tried to stay warm and rest. Since I got on the bus early, I was able to get off and use the bathrooms once and go back on the bus to stay warm and eat the rest of my breakfast. At around 6:00, I left the bus again to line up for the bathrooms which took 20 minutes. Started my warmup around 6:25, lined up into the staging areas at 6:50 in the sub 2:50 group, and the race started at 7:00.

### Race
The race itself had a few moments, but overall, it was a well executed marathon. Knowing all the information about CIM, I knew I needed to hold back on the first half since there were a lot of rolling hills. I ran the inclines by RPE and knew I would make back time on the descents. Fueling wise I planned for a gel every 4 miles, and I carried a soft flask of concentrated carbs so I could take a sip before the water stations to wash it down. The first 20 miles of the race really were quite uneventful. I felt like I was very in control and just cruising along. I was focused on running my race and didn't get carried away by those around me that were running up the hills at a much harder effort. My heart rate was extremely stable and just hovered around the 160 mark which was definitely on the lower end of what I was expecting but I had a good taper leading into the race. The only snag through this first part of the marathon was a side stitch that developed around mile 8. I focused on calming my breathing and taking some deeper breaths in and eventually the stitch went away by mile 10. 

As I crossed mile 20 and looked at my split, I knew I had a chance to run a 2:39:59 if my legs had the strength to run a strong 10k. I started to try and pick up the pace, but my legs just were not turning over fast enough to allow me to bring up the pace I would have needed so I just held steady. The last few miles of this race were just extremely long straightaways which were extremely painful since it just seemed like they went on forever and my legs were definitely struggling. A singular mile never felt so long but Iknew I just had to dig deep and not bleed too much time. Eventually, I made it to the final 2 left turns of the course and crossed the line in a time of 2:43 which is a 10 minute PR!

Overall, I'm really satisfied with how I executed the race with a 1:30 negative split and I know sometime in the future a 2:39 is in the cards, but I'm happy to be walking away with regaining my BQ, a NYC time qualifier and Berlin time qualifier."

My goal A was 3:15, goal B was 3:15 to 3:20, and goal C was simply to PB - my previous best being 3:34–3:35. So to come in at 3:18:42 is something I’m genuinely elated about.

My strategy was based on a strong 20-miler I ran during training, where I blitzed the second half at 7:06 pace. I had hoped to replicate that pattern - cruise for the first half, then pick things up after mile 10. I did try to “go” at mile 10, ran one strong mile around 7:15, but quickly realised my legs didn’t quite have the next gear on the day. So I wisely dialled it back and returned to a steady cruise-control pace.

The Belfast course is tough - not brutal, but full of small, draining inclines that really take it out of you over time. Around mile 18 or 19 I hit a bit of a dip, but I managed to recover and finish strong.

Fueling-wise, I took in about 45g of carbs every half hour, rotating between chews and gels. I drank at every water station and took three electrolyte tablets spaced out roughly once per hour. The strategy worked well - I never bonked, stayed in control, and executed a smart, well-paced race.

I’m super pleased with how it all came together.

So here it is. (sorry about the formatting, not my strength).



Flying Pig Marathon – May 4^(th), 2025, Cincinnati, OH.

 

Weather – 48º and misty.

 

Shoes - HOKA Cielo X1 2.0



Course – Hilly through the first half, then pretty flat.



Me – Male, 47, been running since 2019. I developed vertigo in 2020 which affects my running. Though I have gotten better at managing it over the years.

 

Goal – 3:30:xx, but as I got closer to the race I decided to try and be happy with anything sub 3:40:xx. This was only my second marathon. My first (3:54:25) was part of the Dopey Challenge…so I was curious to see what I could do with just a marathon. Unfortunately, I got in my own head about the hills toward the end of training. Ultimately, I ended up with 3:21:02 – so I hit my goal.

 

Training – I used a bastardized version of Pfitz 18/55. I went into the block already averaging 35-40 mpw, mostly easy runs. The plan started January 1 while I was with students in Costa Rica so while I was able to get some runs in, I certainly wasn’t doing the plan as prescribed. When I returned to central Indiana I attempted the stick to the plan until the end of the month when I sprained my right hip trying to avoid an ice patch on the road. After that I adjusted the plan to have slightly more volume (had a few 60 mile weeks), but slightly less speed workouts. Total miles ran from Jan. 1 – Apr. 30 = 746. I normally strength train while running, but I did zero strength this block, aside from the little bit during PT sessions while getting my hip fixed. I also did zero cross training during this block.

 

Other things of note – I lined up a few races within the training block, two 10K and a ½ marathon. One 10K was slated to happen in the middle of a 20 mile long run…so I ran 6-ish miles to get to the race, ran the race, and then ran another 7-ish home. In both 10K races I PRd…the first was 43:09, then a few weeks later was the other (as part of the 20 mile long run) and I got 43:06. Prior to that I was at 46:xx minutes. The half marathon ended up being canceled then switched to virtual because of weather. I ran the first 8 miles at marathon pace (8:00) and then let loose for the final 5. I ended up with a 1:38:42, prior to that my PR was 1:41:07. My work schedule was also out of control this training block…and my eldest daughter got married the week before the race and I was in charge of décor…so things were a little hectic. Finally, my dear friend ran a marathon the week before me and DNF which really got in my head for some reason.

 

Biggest lessons learned – TRUST YOUR TRAINING! I was trained for this race, I just didn’t believe it. I put in the work, was mostly healthy, and had a decent plan. I was just also in my own head so much it was holding me back. One of my dear friends and training partners said to “run at marathon effort” and don’t worry about pace on the hills. I decided that on every uphill I would NOT look at my watch at all. I didn’t need to see how much I had slowed down. I was, however, free to look at how fast I was on the downhills for a confidence boost! In the end this strategy worked well. My splits aren’t even, but neither was the terrain. Ultimately, I never hit “the wall” and felt really good until mile 25. Even then I was OK…just definitely tired and at the end of wanting to be out there.

 

Fuel – I had two twizzlers that kids were passing out around mile 11. I had three Swedish fish around mile 14. I had one maple syrup packet around mile 20. I had Gatorade at 5-6 of the aid stations along the course. Yes, I was under fueled. And I was also under fueled on all of my long runs and things seem to have worked out pretty OK.

 

The race itself – my plan was to start around 8 minute miles, get through the hills, and then see how I felt. The beginning of the race was also very crowded and I was in Corral C…so I was really forced to slow down and get out of the crowds. My live tracker screwed up and had me at a 10:40 pace, so my wife thought I was hurt right at the start and was worried that when she saw me, I would be limping and mad. Fortunately, that was not the case, and once I could open up a little bit, I did. I felt good and was bored with an 8 minute pace. It’s mostly flat right at the beginning, then as soon as you leave downtown its one really big/long hill. I saw a guy pulled over getting sick on the hill…which was a reminder to not be a hero on the uphill. The race stayed pretty packed through 8 miles, which is where the half marathoners split off. Once we split, I was mostly alone for the rest of the race. Mile 12 was a pretty steady descent, but unfortunately my shoe came untied so I had to stop and tie it. I want those 20 seconds back…I was in a great groove! Fortunately, I was able to get right back to pace. Just bums me out something so silly like that happened. Mile 16 someone was passing out fireball…sadly I didn’t see it until it was too late so I didn’t get that boost. I will also say, my training had me doing 10-14 miles every Tuesday (or Wednesday) and it was a nice reminder that when I hit 16, all I had left was my normal Tuesday run. Things were just really smooth the whole time. My wife was amazing…she found me 5-6 times on the course. The local crowd support was INCREDIBLE. I have never been to any race with crowd support like that. The actual race support was also incredible – hydration station every mile. This was great for me because if I was really cruising, I knew I didn’t have to stop because there would be another very soon. The last little point worth noting is that mile 25 has 3 little rollers in it. They are not bad at all…but I definitely noticed them and audibly groaned at least once.

 

Final thoughts – guys, on a scale from 1-10, this race was a 26.2 for me. I high fived every kid with their hand out. I hit every “power up” sign that I saw. I tried to laugh and make jokes with people who had signs that warranted it. It was all so fun. I would absolutely do this race again in a heartbeat despite the hills. I can’t believe I PRd by 33 minutes. I can’t believe I beat my “stretch” goal by 9 minutes. I can’t believe that damn shoe came untied! I am just over the moon.



I have a backyard ultra in early September and then Marine Corps Marathon in late October. I am hoping to try and use MCM to BQ. I should be able to ramp up training this summer as I don’t work in the summer. And I will definitely be adding strength back into the mix. Also, winter training is HARD but it definitely paid off for me. But those cold/dark/icy mornings are not my jam.

\### Background

32M played ice hockey and lacrosse in high school. played club hockey in college. Have gone running since highschool but would usually run \~5 km at most until COVID. Ran my first ever half marathon distance in 2022. After my daughter was born, running became the only hobby I had time for. Got more consistent running last year.  After breaking 90 minutes solo for a half marathon last fall, I decided to sign up for my first marathon this year and actually train.

\### Training

I didn't follow a specific training plan. I just started ramping up distance week over week for \~10 weeks and did a two-week taper (was forced to start then since snow made it impossible to run for a week in January). I followed Garmin Daily Suggested Workouts at minimum and made sure to get a couple of quality tempo, interval, or threshold sessions and a long run in each week. The most I ran in a week was \~139 km. The longest run I did was 37.25km. I ran lots of hills in preparation for the crazy climb in this race (298m), I exceeded the elevation gain on two of my training runs. I did a half marathon race, my first ever half race, in March (also in Cincinnati - Cincinnati Heart Half) and ran an 84:06 (24th overall!). I had some niggles in my left Achilles and left IT band starting the two week taper, but overall injury free! My last long run was about 3 weeks out at 30.30 km. I never took more than 1 rest day at a time. Somehow only got one mild stomach bug during the 12 weeks of training, a miracle as a parent of a toddler!

\### Pre-race

My in-laws live in Cincinnati so I stayed at their house and was able to get a ride to the race from my father-in-law. Got up around 4, drank a couple cups of coffee. I ate a yogurt, a honey stinger, and another brand of Stroopwafel. Had a dry herb vape walking over to the starting line (nothing new on race day!). I did some dynamic stretching, some pogo hops, skips, and a \~10 minute shuffle before heading to the corral. I was a little annoyed being further back than I wanted. The half race goes out at the same time as the full so it was pretty packed in there. At least I was ahead of the 3:10 pacer group. I couldn't see the 3:05 pacer group there was supposed to be. It's a shame they didn't have an official sub-3 group. Having a pacer for sub 3 would have been a big help for me. Had some honey stinger chews and a Maurten 100 before the race. I drank two 18 oz bottles of water with pedialyte over the two hours pre race. Race started at 6:30.

\### Race

What a rollercoaster race! Probably took the first 5k way too fast. Made an effort to dial it back somewhat to get through 7-13 km where most of the climb is. Started cramping in my right hamstring and calf in the middle of 17km. New goal became to just finish the race so I slowed down for a bit and after some Gatorade and water it abated a little. Thought I was going to throw up around 21 km (started gagging while still running for a few minutes) fueling plan went out the window. Just thinking about more gel made me queazy. I think I had about 3 up to that point while running (two Maurtens and a caffine GU; at like 5km, maybe 14?, and maybe around 18km?). Stuck with Gatorade for the rest of the race. Making sure I drank a lot eased the cramping and I got a little second wind seeing my wife, my two-year-old daughter, and my wife's family in Mariemont. Kept it steady in the last \~12 km. Managed to kick in the last 2 k. Delighted with the result!

\### Post-race

I got my medal, mylar blanket, cried a little, got my bag, and found a porta potty to change into some dry clothes. My legs were/are so sore. I have a couple of blisters on my toes, and my calves and ankles were/are so stiff after going the distance. It was cold and rainy after so I didn't stick around long. Had a dry herb vape, got a Lime scooter and went a couple of blocks to get a Lyft back to the in-laws.

I think I'm going to target shorter distances for a while before trying the marathon again. If I ever run another, I'm choosing a flatter course. Also, I'll probably cave and get some super shoes. I ran this and all my training in Xero Prios. I like running in Prios because I tend to not roll my ankle in them (has been a problem for me in the past). I know I can break 3 and maybe BQ if training goes as well as it did this time, I run a flatter course, and maybe wear some shoes with carbon plates. 

I also might change up my approach fueling. I carb-loaded pretty well (ate a bunch of pizza for lunch two days before and leftovers for lunch the day before, an offensive amount of Tikka Saag Chicken, rice and nann at Ambar Indian two nights before and a nice baked ziti at Giovanni's the night before). I think for my body, if I carb load well, I could get most of my carbs from drinking Gatorade or some equivalent and only take 3 gels with me (or one pack of chews and 2 gels). 

I'll try to add more peak weekly distance and speed work next time. I think I followed Garmin's suggestions too much - too many 'Base Runs' in Garmin's Z3 (\~140bpm-163) for me. I want to break 18 in the 5km, see how quick I can get my mile, and eventually break 80 mins in the half marathon before trying a marathon again.

Positives: 
Good atmosphere, friendly marshalls, enough toilets, fast course.

Could be better:
Couldn't hear the race briefing at the start - you need a bigger speaker than just a megaphone!
Race briefing said water in bottles, it was cups. That didn't bother me, but it's nice to know 
No chip timing - but that keeps the cost down, so all good.

Really pleased with myself as I got a PB of 2:58:31 at the ripe old age of 49. Weather was perfect (for me) not too hot or windy and a well timed rain shower to cool things off.

This is my local race and I fully recommend it."

# Training

I followed Hal Higdon’s Novice 1 plan.  Didn’t have much running background before starting — this was basically couch to marathon for me.  I did do a lot of sports growing up so I had some base, but was never in track or XC.  The initial ramp up in mileage was a little tough and i dealt with some initial knee pain but it passed within a couple weeks as my body got used to running more.

Training went mostly to plan but i didn't follow it exactly. Took me a bit to get used to running 4x/week and some vacations got in the way of some workouts.  During my peak week, I got sick and missed the entire week of running. It was definitely rough and it took a week or two to get back to normal, but I still got most of the long runs and weekly mileage in otherwise.  Throughout training I was also dealing with some front hip flexor pain which I think was due to weak hip flexors/glutes.  I didn't do much strength training which I think would have definitely helped.

Looking back I'm pretty surprised at how low of mileage i had across the training block compared to what's typically suggested.  But i think for never running much before i probably couldn't have handled much more weekly mileage

[Mileage vs. Training Week](https://preview.redd.it/oiak9lwzugxe1.jpg?width=994&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b54012fd15d079be156067a2ff95a49db36641b5)

# Pre-race

Woke up at 4:30 AM on race day and had a bagel and an egg along with some orange juice. About 30 minutes before the start, I had some carb-electrolyte mix and a honey stinger waffle.  

# Race

I was running the race with my wife (both our first marathons) and our goal was to finish together under 4:30 which based on our training seemed like a solid goal.  The Salt Lake City course starts with a lot of downhill for the first \~10 miles.  Everyone says to save energy for the second half/last 10K, but we definitely used the downhill to bank some time early on without feeling like we were overexerting ourselves. 

I felt strong through the early miles. After mile 13 or so, it definitely got sunnier and warmer, but we generally stayed on top of hydration by hitting every water stop for Gatorade and water. 

Since my longest run was only 16 miles I had no idea how I was going to feel once we got past mile 16.  Surprisingly I felt really good, and we were right at a 10:00 pace so I was ready to pick it up around mile 20 and push for a sub-4:20, but my wife was having a bit of a harder time by then so we backed off a bit and focused on finishing the race together (and still under 4:30).

We crossed the finish line in 4:28, hitting our primary goal of finishing under 4:30! Super proud of how it all came together.  For fueling we took gels every 30min, typically right before the water stations.  

# Post-race

I'm honestly surprised how good I feel the day after. Definitely sore, but nothing too bad — way better than I expected after running 26.2 miles.

The entire energy of the marathon was a really cool first time experience - from all the spectators to the mariachi band at the capital (a highlight of the race), the energy was really great and kept my spirits up throughout.  

Excited to plan out my next marathon and choose a heavier mileage training plan (looking at Hanson's beginner) and see what I can really do but pretty happy overall with the first marathon experience.  "

Just finished London marathon which was my third marathon. Prior PB was 3:36 high in Honolulu. 

Started a 16 week training block on Runna in January. At the outset of the plan the paces looked aggressive and it had lots of speed work (Monday intervals, Wednesday tempo and every other week marathon pace in long run), but I was hitting the splits so I stuck with it. As the weeks went on and the mileage/paces increased I could feel the fatigue, but didn't listen to my body. At this point I was on the razor's edge and stupidly didn't back off. Then on an interval run, Monday 3/2, I pulled up with glute/hip flexor pain I had been managing and had to walk/run (mainly walk) home three miles. Essentially couldn't run for 3.5 weeks during the peak portion of my training block (missing my peak mileage weeks and long runs of 20, 21 and 20).

At this point I was hoping to just finish around 4 hours (maybe) as I thought my fitness would drop off a cliff and the pain during running was bad. Luckily I have a road bike and home gym. Started cycling 6-7 hours a week which didn't bother my injury. Also did lots of band work and different types of resistance training to strengthen hips and glutes. I did a few long rides, longest being 75 miles . Was able to get some anaerobic work in via intervals and LOTS of zone 2. Eventually my pain resolved and I got back to easy running. 

I knew the speed work (particularly intervals) caused the injury so I stayed away from that and started with small pieces of marathon pace. First week back did 20 miles, next week did 26, then two weeks of 32 miles before I did a 1.5 week taper before London. During this time I decided to ramp my long runs up by time. I did a 60 minute, 90 minute, 120 minute and 150 minute long run and increased marathon pace block each time eventually getting to 11 miles at marathon pace. At this point I realized the cycling base transfers extremely well and felt like I had a shot at a PB and could go for 3:30. 

On race day it was hot and I told myself I would just go out and hold on as long as I could (this is not my style lol). It was an absolute battle. Not smart, but my goal was to positive split given the rising temp. I banked a solid 4 minutes, but less given the crowds making it so I couldn't run the tangents well plus dodging people. Around mile 16 through canary wharf I slowed a bit but battled on. Last 10k was an absolute war zone. People were dropping like flies and stretching with cramps everywhere. Almost got a cramp through osmosis lol. Dug deep and just hung on to the finish knowing where I was on time. Was struggling so hard and i didn't even notice Buckingham palace crossing finish line. Finished with a chip time of 3:29:08 (7+ min PB)! 

Sorry for making this so long, but given the injury, crowds and heat, I am extremely proud of this time and new PB. I learned two things I hope help others:

1. Listen to your body! It will speak to you and you need to listen. It is exciting to hit super fast splits, but it is something completely different to hit a split/workout versus being in the shape to ABSORB the stimulus from that workout. This is why just mimicking what your favorite athlete does doesn't work. They are absorbing because they earned that workout while we do it and just drag the fatigue into the next workout despite completing it. It keeps adding up and boom, injury....
2. Cross training works!!! I started at like 32 MPW and got up to 46mpw. Original plan was to peak at 58. As you can see from above, never made it past 46 and last month never got over 32MPW. I mention all this because the cycling SAVED me. I also fell back in love with cycling again and am keeping it in my routine (plus the newbie gains in cycling that month were amazing haha). Can't recommend it enough to people who have access. 

Anyways, I hope this advice helps a few people. Cheers!

Three years ago, I ran a half marathon in 1:21:00, but I hadn’t improved since. I believed there was more in the tank.

I started training in early December 2023, initially not aiming for a marathon but with the goal of reducing my weight from 66 kg to around 61 kg. Training went well right from the start, averaging 80–90 km per week during the first 3–4 months.

In March 2024, the idea of running a marathon took shape. I’d never run a road marathon before, only the distance twice during trail races. I chose the Verona Marathon on November 17 as my target.

After some successful shorter races between April and July, I started my proper marathon preparation in July. At first, my goal was to run sub-3:00, but after comfortably hitting that pace in training, I adjusted my goal to sub-2:50. My weekly mileage during this period was around 100–120 km. I didn’t miss a single workout and often went above what my plan prescribed.

However, four weeks before the race, I caught COVID. This disrupted my training significantly. I had planned a key workout of 1.5 hours at marathon pace during this time, but I had to stop after just 25 minutes at 3:50/km pace—the day I tested positive. After recovering, I managed to redo the workout and completed it at a 3:47/km pace, though it took a lot of effort. Based on this, I set a race pace goal of 3:55/km. The taper felt mediocre, but I stuck to the plan.

The day before the race, my wife and I traveled to Verona by train. After picking up my bib, I carbo-loaded heavily—something I hadn’t tested extensively before. My biggest concern wasn’t the time but how my stomach would hold up, as I’d occasionally had issues during long runs. For the race, I planned to take three Maurten 160 gels and one GU gel, along with one Maurten gel before the start.

Race morning, I woke up at 5:45 AM for breakfast. Nerves were high, but conditions were perfect: 4–5°C and cloudy. My start was at 8:33 AM in the second wave.

The race began fast, and I kept reminding myself to hit 3:55/km splits. To my surprise, every kilometer up to 10 km was sub-3:50. I felt amazing—no stomach issues, no major effort. I passed the half marathon mark in a new PB of 1:18. At this point, I kept thinking, “Either this will be a dream race, or I’m going to crash hard.”

I felt the first signs of fatigue around 27 km, but I managed to recover after the 35 km mark and push through. I crossed the finish line in 2:40:44.

The only slight disappointment was missing an official sub-2:40 because my watch recorded 42.58 km. But overall, this race far exceeded my expectations. I felt incredible the entire way—it was an amazing experience! Starting in the second wave somehow gave me a psychological boost becaus i overtook a lot of runners.

Fazit: This has left me hungry for more. I can’t wait to see what I’m capable of next!

**Training**:

This was my B race, a tune up half before my first full marathon (NYC) in 4 weeks. A few friends were running it and I jumped in just for fun. Since the start of August I’ve been following Hansons/Luke Humphrey’s 16 week NYC specific plan, averaging 55-60mpw. It’s based on classic Hanson plan but substitutes some of the speed/strength workouts for hill workouts. I had added some extra easy miles but kept the long run to 16 miles and did not modify any of the quality SOS days except sometimes having to do a slightly longer cooldown to get home. 

Up to the tune up half I had done 3 60+ mile weeks, highest 62, with the other weeks 54-57, and ran 4 16 miler long runs. My week usually went Mon- speed/hills/strength, Tue- easy w hills, Wed- easy, Thu- MP tempos, Fri- easy, Sat- long run w hills, Sun- rest/swim. I never missed a day but failed to hit paces on 2 recent workouts - a 2x4 mile MP tempo and a 2x5 mile MP tempo, 2 weeks apart, that I attributed to a gel that just did not work for me (common factor in both days). Both days I could only do 3-4 miles at MP before I knew something was off (mile 2 effort felt like mile 7 last week etc) and gave up, but both days I felt better by the afternoon and ran a second run and got in the originally planned volume at both MP and total. Other than that I executed every workout. I was feeling a bit uneasy with the 2 failed MP workouts, but sandwiching both were 8 mile continuous MP tempos that I did hit and felt strong on.

I did yoga 3-4x a week, no other strength or cross training. No injuries or niggles, felt much better than the last cycle where I tried to fit in 2x strength on top. Weekly is usually 1 vinyasa class for strength/core, 1 hips/shoulders class, 1 stretch & splits, and 1 inversions class for fun. Foam rolling and massage ball when watching TV. 

Nutrition wise I practiced getting in 60g/h of carbs on every SOS day. Through trial and error I found out I need at least 1000mg in sodium (a lmnt or 4 nuuns) on runs >10 miles/90min in my home climate. 



**Goal / Paces:** 

I live/train in Singapore where it’s super hot and humid (84-90F, 85-90% humidity even at 5-6am), and all my workouts were ran to a 3:40 goal marathon pace. My 3:40 goal was set from a 5k (23min) parkrun in this weather. I knew I would be faster in cooler weather but did not have confidence in how much faster to target. My Garmin said 1:40 so I decided to go for 1:40. Before this I ran my first marathon in Dec 2022 in 2:02, had a baby, then ran my second in March this year in Japan (1:52, followed Hansons beginner half book plan) at 6mo post partum. I figured 1:40 was nice because it translates to a 3:30 full per the Hansons calculator and that was the old BQ standard for me. So I set a goal pace of 7:40/mile for the half (which I  miscalculated by failing to account for the 0.1 and the extra distance I will likely need to run, ran 13.36 total) and hoped for the best. I trained in Endorphin Speeds / Shifts and laced up the Endorphin Elites for the race. I did not do any HMP workouts and that made me a bit nervous. 



**Mini Taper:**

The week of the half I did my normal speed workout on Mon (a hill workout), then ran Tue easy, Wed 10 mile easy but hilly, Thu/Fri super easy, Sat off (did a 1 hour bike ride to explore Rottnest), then Sun was the race. I didn’t want to taper too much since my peak week for the marathon is actually the week after the half. So I still ran 55 miles the week of the half (including the half) and will ramp up after for 1 more week to 60 before the marathon taper. I felt pretty decent by Sun morning but it was obviously not a full taper. I had 2 glasses of wine on Fri for the pre race dinner with friends which was a mistake, because I didn’t sleep super well Fri or Sat and woke up with a migraine on Sat so had to take 4 Excedrins over the course of Sat. My Garmin Training Readiness read 87 on Sun morning. 



**Carb loading:**

I took this as an opportunity to practice carb loading, since I haven’t done it for any long runs yet aside from eating a pasta dinner the night before. I ate more bread on Thu, ate an extra Precision 90g gel on Fri/Sat (this is the one that did not work for me and what I took on the 2 failed MP runs, so I figured I use it to carb load instead), and ate pizza/pasta on Sat for lunch/dinner. I don’t count and ate intuitively but figured I probably get in 200-250g of carbs normally, and Featherstone recommends 400g for a 3 day carb load for the marathon, so an extra 80-90g can come from gel/carbs and the rest I will just pivot to more pasta/pizza/bread but stop when I feel full. Featherstone also talks about hyper hydrating so I drank a lmnt on Sat night to try. I felt uncomfortable but not super stuffed. My running shorts were normally a bit loose but felt tight on race morning. 



**Race Day:**

Race was at 8am. I got up at 6am and drank 1/2 of a Maurten 320 and a coffee. I took the other half and sipped on it as we left for the race, and kept 1/4 for just before. The weather was warmer than I hoped, 72-74F with humidity at 86%, but relative to the Singapore weather it was still much easier to run. With 10min to go I finally made it to the rest room, drank the last 1/4 of my Maurten, ditched my sweater, and got in with the wave 1 runners. 

The first mile was a bit crowded but it thinned out pretty fast. I took off and was running 7:30ish, felt pretty good, saw my HR was low in the 130s, and it felt pretty manageable. The was 118m (387ft) of total elevation gain and it was mostly in the first half. I slowed to 7:50-8:10 on the ups, and ran 6:50-7 on the downs, focusing on even effort. I find it easy to just let gravity do the work on the downhills, and folks would often pass me on the ups and I would pass them on the downs. 

The first half I ran 7:20-7:30s miles, and my HR was still reading 130s-140s, and somehow even trended down. At this point it dawned on me that the HR must be wrong because on my last half in Japan (which was much colder in the 40s-50s F) my HR was in the 150s-160s, and rose to 170s on the last few miles. I was running to the effort that I could recall from the Japan half as best as I can so it’s unlikely my HR was actually only 130-140s. By mile 6 or 7 when we got out of the tunnel the sun was out in full blast and it got quite a bit warmer. It started to feel hard by mile 9 to hold on to the pace but I knew it was relatively flat from there on out and figured I had banked a bit of time in the first half that if I just held on and ran the remaining miles at 7:40 I would hit my goal. With this being my B race I also didn’t want to risk overdoing it and decided I will just try to hit the 1:40.  I kept the pace even around 7:40 to the finish.

I felt like I could’ve dug a bit deeper but it was a hard 9/10 effort. In my last half I accelerated significantly in the last 3 miles and felt like I had left a lot in the tank, but this one felt like it was an even, properly paced effort. I didn’t double over at the finish, I felt pretty good after, and felt like I could’ve kept running (at a slower pace) if I had to. This was a 14 min PR from 6mon ago, it felt a bit surreal that my HM pace went down by about a minute per mile in just 6 months! The 5k park run I had ran in Singapore (in 90F weather) at the start of my marathon block to set a goal pace was 7:24 miles, and on Sun I held 7:33 for a half, only 9 sec/mile slower than my 5k PR. Since I don’t race in Singapore given the heat/humidity, I ended up setting my PRs for every single distance from 5k to the half marathon on Sun, without any HM specific training or a full taper. 

Nutrition wise I took 4 untapped gels, 1 caffeinated and 3 salted, and took them at 3, 6 (caffeinated), 8.5, 11.5 miles. The plan was to take them every 3 miles. The water stations were a bit sparse, only 5 total I think, and there was a long stretch of what felt like 4+ miles without any. I usually run with a hydration vest w a 1.5L bladder but since NY does not allow them I wanted to try running without the pack and only took a 350ml handheld bottle. I tried to drink from the cups for the first 2 water stations and failed, but figured out by the 3rd station it was easier to just pour 3-4 cups into my bottle as I ran through and it would be 75% full. I started my bottle with a half pack of lmnt (figuring it was cooler and I wouldn’t need as much sodium), and that was gone by mile 4. I also made the mistake of not looking at what I was grabbing (course was offering both water and gatorade) and took a half bottle of gatorade by accident, which exceeded the g/h of carbs I was used to practicing with and also didn’t sit very well in my stomach as I had never trained with it. I was feeling a bit of stomach cramps by mile 9 or 10 but it was manageable.



**Post Race:**

I drank a bottle of water, picked up my drop bag, changed, and mixed up my protein shake that I had prepared. I tried to drink some gatorade but that didn’t feel very good and I also really didn’t feel like eating either. Stretched and waited around a bit for my friends to finish, took photos, and took the train back to the hotel where I had some pastries, yogurt, fruit. We then took a lovely visit to Swan Valley for wine tasting and lunch/dinner. Unfortunately I realised as I was getting ready for bed that I had dropped my AirPods when I was changing earlier, and it was still somewhere in Optus Stadium. Since I was flying out the day after I figured if I had any hope of finding them I would need to go down that night, and after much pleading with the security guards found them in a locked container behind a restricted fence at 11pm (someone must have found them and gave it to the staff). The security guards couldn’t open it and told me I had to come back the next day, but it worked out in the end and I got them back the next morning. 

The day after I couldn’t waste the chance to run in the cooler weather one more time, so did an 8.5 mile recovery run and it actually felt really good. My HR was reading in the 120s the entire time at a 9:30-9:45ish pace - I had never seen my HR in the 120s! In Singapore I run 10.30-11 min miles as my recovery pace and my HR is still in the high 130s to mid 140s. 



**Marathon Goal:**

If I use the Hanson race equivalency calculator this half suggests I can finish a full between 3:26 (by strava time) and 3:29 (by official).  But Garmin only predicts 3:36. Since NY is a hard course I’m wondering how much I need to adjust that by to account for the hills. On the other hand I’ve done a lot of hill specific workouts and didn’t struggle with the 2 bridges on Sun, and I didn’t have the benefit of a full taper for this half. So should I target 3:30 or 3:40?"
1cfyhvw,2024-04-29 12:59:14+00:00,beenzmcgee,,Marathon_Training,/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1cfyhvw/race_report_first_half/,Race Report: First Half,"I (26M) signed up for my first half marathon in December and just ran it this weekend with a time of 1:51.

Coming into this I had some running experience at most 20 mi/week, but not consistent. My main focus for the majority of my life has been strength training. Initially I had set my goal at 2 hours for the half, but about a month before the half I pushed my goal quite a bit, to 1:45, and I was progressing fairly quick.

Now to the race. Miles 0-4, I experienced really weird stiffness in my ankles, almost like I couldn’t point my toes up. I stuck to my plan, and came out at around 8:30 with the intention to speed up later on. Now from miles 4-5, I was for sure I was going to shit myself. I was panicking looking around for a porta potty to no avail. Sometime after mile 5 the feeling passed and it was replaced by hardcore side stitches from miles 5-finish. Whenever I would try to push over 8:30, I could feel the side stitches start to come in. Anyway I finished with a 1:51 and I’m not super stoked, nor am I disappointed. I think that’s a respectable time for a first time runner at 210 bw.

Some takeaways: Get better sleep. Less caffeine. Too much Gatorade on course. Learn how to drink while running. Do a shakeout run the day before race day. 

3 weeks before my half, I had a 10 mi run at 8:15 min/mi pace and maintained an avg HR of 150. My avg HR for this race was 158 at a way slower pace. I’m guessing this was a culmination of anxiety, too much caffeine, and only getting 4 hours of sleep.

Can’t wait to do my full marathon in October!"

This is my 4th marathon, and I finally feel like I've executed the race correctly. I hit the wall on my first from going out too fast, and on my second because I ran a 4 race challenge weekend. The third I was recovering from injury, but was my first where I didn't walk at all. This one just feels like I learned what I needed to learn finally, and everything just clicked in to place. I'm hoping this helps someone else that was where I was before.

# Training Methodology

I wish I had something better to say here. In the fall last year I used the Pfitz base building plan as written and built to 60 miles over the course of 10 weeks. I ran an 18:30 5k off of that. Excited by that result I set forth to do his 18/70 plan for this spring race. I made it two weeks. The winter weather was absolutely horrid, and we had snow down for an entire month. I lost a lot of motivation here. 18/70 turned in to 18/55 which turned in to 12/55 and even then I peaked at 41 mpw. Most weeks were between 30-40 mpw. I got in to a bad mental state from the weather and it was really hard to get out. I rallied decently through March and April and was able to salvage the plan somewhat.

I'm a very data oriented person, and I use the [https://vdoto2.com/calculator/](https://vdoto2.com/calculator/) religiously for planning. My training paces were based on my 18:30 5k result, and I felt like these were accurate as I was running them.

# Goal Setting

I knew I wasn't executing the plan well, but even so I needed to know where I was at. After a respectable 20 miler on the course at an 8:00 min/mile pace I had a confidence boost. I employed my normal strategy of running a shorter than goal race tune-up. I ran a half marathon in April in 1:27 with a closing pace of 6:17 min/mile over the last 5k. This surprised me, but gave me the confidence I had been lacking up until now.

Using the above calculator this predicts a 3:01:35 marathon time. Knowing that my course is hilly I mentally shifted this to 3:05. I also asked ChatGPT to use some of my data, including the half marathon splits, to set me A, B and C goals. These ended up as 3:00-3:03, 3:05-3:08, and 3:10-3:15. It was adamant that 3:10-3:15 was a 100% lock unless something catastrophic happened. Based on these factors I decided to shoot for 3:05.

# Race Strategy

So how do you plan to run a 3:05 on a hilly course? The answer is certainly not to run 6:56 every mile for 26.2 miles. I run with a Garmin watch and one of the features of that watch is called Pace Pro. It essentially lets you build a pace plan for a specific race based on goal time or pace. It has an option to use elevation based splits instead of mile/k splits. I turned this as high as it would go. This essentially cuts the race mostly in to uphill, downhill, and flat sections. Then, to make sure I made it through the big climb unscathed, I used a 3:10 goal time for the first 9 miles of splits, and a 3:03 goal time for the remainder of the race. This should have averaged out to about 3:05 when all was said and done. This allowed me ""permission"" to run a 7:30 mile going up hill, and green-lit some faster 6:30 downhill sections. The strategy here was to bank effort early, not time.

# Gear and Fuel Plan

Simple fuel plan for me. I used 7 Maurten gels as per their recommendation. I took 1 about 15 minutes before the start, and the rest I took every 6k throughout the race. There are aid stations every mile so I took a Gatorade cup at each one. Race morning was coffee and a pack of Pop Tarts, and a Maurten 160 drink.

I wore half-tights with gels in pockets, and a singlet with arm sleeves. The shoes were Adidas Adios Pro 3.

# Race Execution

# Miles 1-9:

I started the race with the 3:10 pace group. This was to help keep me honest and not go to fast. Mile 1 was pretty congested so a but slower than target, but we made up for it. My HR hit 157 at one point on the climb which made me nervous, but it recovered back to where I wanted it to be at afterwards so I didn't worry about it too much. I was 1 second ahead of schedule here, so the first part of the race went perfectly.

# Miles 10-20:

This is where I shifted to the faster paces in my plan. This section is a bunch of rollers and flats that are pretty nice to run through. Everything here was clicking, and the pace was like clockwork. The plan here was that if I hit mile 20 and still had my HR under 152 then I was green-lit to increase my pace.

# Miles 21-24:

I decided to hold off on an increase until 22. Even then I could tell that I was reaching the end of my fitness. See lack of training. Either way I tried to increase by a little.

# Miles 25-End:

Well, I'm increasing anyways. It's only 2 miles! Was able to run a 6:45, 6:35 and then close the rest at 6:15. It's amazing what the finish line and crowd support can fuel!

# Reflections

What went well:

* Ran a \~4 min negative split from the first half to the second
* Probably my best executed race
* Conservative pacing early allowed me to finish strong
* No GI or cramping issues — fueling plan worked

What to improve:

* I just needed more volume in training to help close the last 10k better

I hope something in this report helps someone out there run a better marathon.

I got out of shape but have gotten back into cardio again with some regularity but I usually run/walk since I don’t like to keep a steady pace on the treadmill and I’m doing it just to burn calories, not achieve a time. I haven’t ran outside in a long time but that’s where I can keep up a steady light jogging pace.

Anyway, I don’t particularly feel sore after my 5k cardio sessions. Could I do a half marathon next week, provided I’m just doing a light jog the whole time? I just want to finish without injury, I don’t care about time. My run/walk pace is around 36/37 minutes for 3 miles."

### Training
I don’t know that I have fully seen myself represented in other threads on race reports or “what time should I go for” questions. 

This was my third year running the Vancouver Marathon (3:19 in 2023, and 3:09 in 2024). New this year was a dedicated interval/speed day with a local run club and faster pace for “easy” days (~4:25-4:35/km). Volume averaging around 80km/week, peaking at 110/100km/week. Some pullbacks for races and minor injury. Very much a vibes based training plan - no formal structure aside from running with a group on Tuesdays and a long run (24-32km) on either Saturday or Sunday. 

I had built to 110km/week at the end of March but had to pull back due to some overuse pain in my left knee. Physio consult and IMS over three sessions got me back up to 100km before a two week taper. 

Jan-May total mileage - 1280km - 38% more than the previous years’ volume over the same period.

### Pre-race
Nothing too special - ~65km taper week one, and 30km in taper week two. Some light stretching and mobility exercises before race start. 

### Race
8 degrees C at the 8:30am start line and warming to 14C with no clouds and a light breeze. 5x Maurten 160s roughly every 7km. Chewable salt tabs shortly after each gel. 300ml soft flask in hand for the whole race, supplemented by on course electrolytes and water. Course starts off with significant elevation loss for first 6km then sharp increase at km 9. Further quad-destruction-inducing decline at km 19. Did my best to focus on turnover and smooth strides throughout the race and relied on the strength of previous races this year (1/2M 1:18, 10k 35:50) to be confident in running below a 4:00/km pace.

### Post-race
Last year I messed up my taper and ran a 3:09, this year I had great weather and better preparation - all leading to a 26 minute personal best! Taking it easy this week then transitioning into my first ultra and first ever trail race with a 50k in August. BQ also looks pretty safe at nearly 12 minutes below the standard! 

Fellow vibes-based runners - you don’t necessarily need a named runnning plan/methodology to find success!

# Goals

|Goal|Description|Completed?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A|< 4 hours|*Yes*|
|B|< 4:10 hours|*Yes*|
|C|Finish|*Yes*|

Some background because I am mostly writing this to reflect, and if it helps anyone, that’d be nice too. Without getting too deep I am just trying to have some honest thoughts about why I ran and what kept me from doing it in the past.

I started running about 5 years ago as a “pretty big guy” I was 5ft10 305-310lbs. I’m now down to 220, but to put it bluntly, still a “pretty big guy” big gut, moobs, and unflattering jiggles in race day photos galore. While I see myself as a runner, I get lots of comments about how I don’t look like a runner, how people are surprised I could finish a run, or I don’t want to finish behind you. It’s always weird to me, and people usually try to pass it off as some sort of compliment (maybe it is and I am still a bit insecure), but it’s the reality and I hear the comments a lot.

I had always wanted to be a runner. Why? I don’t really know. It just appealed to me is all I can say. A combination of shame, lack of confidence, and lack of ability had always stopped me from even starting, but this time it stuck. I started off trying to run a mile in under 10 minutes, a 5k under 30 minutes, a 10k under an hour, a half under 2 hours, and finally just run a marathon. Each time I hit a goal I moved on to the next step. New starting line new distance. I never wanted to linger at the current distance or try to improve it past those times. I just had eyes for the marathon. I told everyone I’d never do it, but when I’d reflect I knew I just said that because if I failed I’d just be too ashamed to admit I couldn’t do it, and with the weight that seemed like an even more shameful failure. The first 3 years I ran anywhere from 200-600 miles a year, the 4th year I ran a bit over 1300, and now I’m currently at 850.

**Training**

The year I ran my first Marathon a year ago and I did an NRC training. Just with the goal to finish. I had never done anything over 13 miles and knew I just needed to be able to run the distance. I finished at 4:58, falling apart quite badly at mile 21. After that I started training using Hal Higdon’s app, but never did a marathon after that training block. For 2025 I decided I would run Chicago, and I wanted to give it an honest effort. I decided I would do the pfitz 18/55 plan, and that I’d do a practice marathon with that same training block. The goal was to finish the plan, see if I can handle the volume, and run under 4 hours at a relatively easy pace to start the next 18/55 feeling fresh. I bought the book and set up the google sheet I found on Reddit to track my runs and get my paces with a 4 hour goal. I managed to finish every run but one. A 12-mile run, I wasn’t feeling after a crummy week, I decided to be done with at mile 6. I just didn’t want to be in my head anymore that day. I hit all the goal paces, and I remember being ecstatic at completing the 18 mile with 14 miles MP exactly at 9 minutes. I negative split 2/3 of my 20-mile runs. Since I never go back to a race I PR’d all the other distances during my training runs. Nothing crazy as it was in the middle of a lot of running, but still nice to see (Mile 7:11, 5k 23:11, 10k 48:05, HM 1:54). I lost about 20 pounds over the course of those 18 weeks. I made sure to eat right and drink enough water. I maintained an emphasis on having quality runs. So I went to bed early, made sure I was hydrated, and ate right before hard sessions (I tried to do this for every run, but more focused on the hard ones). I also lifted 5 days a week with a PPL plan where I did legs only once a week. Honestly, I just followed the most repeated advice here. Did my easy runs easy, got miles on my feet, put in hard effort for hard runs, and I trusted the process.

**Pre-Race/Race**

I decided early on that this would not be an all out effort. I wanted it to feel easy and controlled and to get to the end in under 4 hours. I decided I’d walk through all the aid stations to grab water, I would high five anyone waiting for one, tap any signs that offered a boost, and to track down my girlfriend for a kiss at any of the points she was meeting me. There is also one big hill towards the end, I decided early on I was just walking. I told myself I’d follow the 10/10/10 rule and to also tell myself that all my training was for that last 10k. I wish I could break it down mile by mile but honestly it felt like I looked down at my watch and I was at mile 13. Made it through a little bit of a climb and a bathroom stop and all of a sudden I was at mile 19. I ran strong from there since my girlfriend called me to tell me she was adding a stop at mile 22 and I wanted to see her. After that I felt like I had it. I enjoyed the next two miles at a pretty easy pace since it was uphill and I wanted to finish strong later, I walked up that hill, and spent a few minutes fixing my bib (to be honest my nipples were bleeding pretty bad and I didn’t want it to ruin the photos). I got to mile 25 and went to cruise control from there.

**Post-Race**

A week has passed, and I’m proud of that run but more proud of the entire 4 month block. I took a week off, and my legs feel great. I’ll be starting the same 18/55 training block in a bit for Chicago with a goal of 3:30. Maybe a stretch, but failing is fine."
